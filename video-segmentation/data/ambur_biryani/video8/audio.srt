00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.180
I had shown Nambur biryani earlier, but today I'm making Ambur biryani. It's very simple and quick to prepare.

2
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.180
Add mint leaves, coriander leaves, pudina, half a spoon of black pepper, garam masala, and one tablespoon of red chili powder and turmeric.

3
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.960
After mixing all this, I kept it aside to marinate for a while.

4
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.080
Don’t use a big vessel. Use a flat-bottomed pot for best results.

5
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.080
If you have biryani pots at home, use a medium-sized one. For 1 kg, this size works well.

6
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
If not, use a pressure cooker, but don’t close it fully.

7
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.080
You can also use a thick-bottomed vessel for better heat retention.

8
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
Now it’s cooking—let’s prepare the tomato mixture.

9
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.760
Now it’s ready. I’ve sautéed the tomatoes in oil.

10
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.640
Add a bit more tomato for this biryani than usual.

11
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.160
Add a few more than usual, around four.

12
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.840
I’ve taken three finely chopped tomatoes.

13
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.000
If you don’t have puree, chop and use them.

14
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.080
Sauté them well.

15
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.760
Unlike dum biryani, Ambur biryani is more like a pulav with dum at the end.

16
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.900
Add red chili powder, coriander powder, and mix well.

17
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.220
Mix well and cook until the oil separates. The taste comes from this base.

18
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.200
Then add garam masala, cooked rice, coriander, and pudina. Fry this nicely.

19
00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:22.180
Finally, mix everything well with the rice.
