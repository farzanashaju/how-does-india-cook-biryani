Hello foodies, welcome to Ismail Food Evality! Today we’re making the world-famous Malabar Chicken Dum Biryani. You may have eaten many chicken dum biryanis, but this Malabar version is unique — its method, ingredients, and flavors are all different. Try it once — you’ll definitely love it. Let’s start!

2
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:31,687
Add 1/4 nutmeg and two mace blades.

3
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:59,667
About half a tablespoon of black pepper. [unintelligible due to long stretch]

4
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:23,713
This turns into a powder like this. You can store it in airtight jars and preserve it easily for 2–3 months. Now, for chicken masala, take 1-inch ginger and 5–6 garlic cloves.

5
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:33,129
For the chicken gravy, heat ¼ cup oil in a pan. Add 150g thinly sliced onions and fry until golden brown.

6
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:59,084
Once the onions begin to fry, add some salt to speed up the process. Once they turn golden brown, add 2 curry leaves and continue frying.

7
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:23,552
Once the masala paste rises to the top in the oil, add 1 tsp coriander powder, ⅛ tsp turmeric powder, and ½ tsp of the homemade garam masala. Cook the masala until it thickens.

8
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:53,185
After cooking for 3–4 minutes, finely chop 2 tomatoes and add them. Mix well. Once they soften, add curd and mix thoroughly. After 7–8 minutes of cooking, you’ll see oil rising to the top.

9
00:02:57,538 --> 00:03:08,372
After 12 minutes, the chicken is about 80% cooked. The rest will cook on dum. Add some chopped mint and coriander on top.

10
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:41,330
Now, for biryani rice, take 2 cups of short-grain “Chitti Muthyalu” rice. I'm using the Sudhanya brand short rice for this recipe.

11
00:03:42,949 --> 00:04:09,004
Once rice is 80% cooked, in a separate pan, melt ¼ cup ghee. Add ¼ cup cashews and fry until golden. When they change color, add 10–15 raisins and fry lightly.

12
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:39,564
In the remaining ghee, add 2 medium sliced onions and fry till golden brown. While onions are frying, add 2-inch cinnamon sticks, 10 cloves, 10 cardamoms, and salt to taste.

13
00:04:42,028 --> 00:05:09,214
In about 6–7 minutes, everything will turn golden brown. The rice must be cooked to that light golden color. Once done, for every 2 cups of rice, double the water is used.

14
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:23,726
As you can see, after about 12–14 minutes, my rice is about 80% cooked.

15
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:54,254
Now for dum cooking, take a large handi, add 50% of the prepared chicken gravy along with the chicken pieces and spread evenly. Then layer 50% of the cooked ghee rice on top.

16
00:05:57,494 --> 00:06:25,050
Now add the remaining rice on top of the chicken. Over the rice, sprinkle chopped mint, coriander, all the fried dry fruits, and 2 pinches of garam masala.

17
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:49,350
Turn off the flame and let it rest for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, open the lid — look at how beautiful it is! Steaming hot and fragrant Malabar Chicken Dum Biryani is ready!

18
00:06:49,350 --> 00:07:15,322
Usually, Keralites enjoy biryani with pappadam and pickle, followed by Suleimani tea — a great digestive. This is a very simple recipe. How is this Kerala special Malabar Chicken Dum Biryani?
