Greetings to all! I'm Mehema Supramanya and welcome to Home Cooking Telugu. Every place has its own unique biryani recipe with distinct flavors. So today, I'm making Malabar-style Talassery Biryani.

2
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:51,954
First, let’s prepare the garam masala powder. In a pan, add 4 cardamoms, 2 pieces of cinnamon, 5 cloves, 2 star anise, ½ tsp pepper, 2 small nutmegs, and 2 pieces of mace.

3
00:00:52,494 --> 00:01:22,447
Dry roast these spices on a low flame for about 2 minutes until aromatic. Then switch off the stove, let it cool, and grind them into a fine powder. Set this aside.

4
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:44,420
Next, I’m frying onions. Heat some oil in a pan and once hot, add thinly sliced onions and fry them. I’ve taken about 2 large onions here.

5
00:01:44,420 --> 00:02:12,280
These are called fried onions. They add a lot of flavor to the biryani. As you can see, they’ve turned brown. Once golden and crispy, take them out and keep them aside.

6
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:29,576
In the same pan, add ½ cup of white raisins. Once they're fried, transfer them to a bowl and set aside for garnish.

7
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:47,937
Now for the chicken masala: take a wide pan and add ¼ cup ghee. Add 4 finely chopped onions and sauté. The more onions, the better the taste of the biryani.

8
00:02:49,793 --> 00:03:17,569
[Unclear audio section, assumed continuation of sautéing and cooking onions, possibly mentioning stirring continuously and cooking until brown.]

9
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:53,530
After sautéing for 5 minutes, add ½ tsp turmeric, 2 tsp ginger garlic paste. Sauté this well. On high flame, add chicken pieces and cook until the raw smell goes away.

10
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:14,388
[Unclear audio; likely continuing chicken cooking steps and spice additions.]

11
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:37,101
After 10 minutes, I’m adding ½ cup thick curd. Stir it well so the curd doesn't split and gives a smooth texture. Continue cooking the chicken on high flame.

12
00:04:45,826 --> 00:05:07,459
Add 2-3 handfuls of the fried onions to enhance the flavor. Finally, add fresh coconut milk and give it a good mix.

13
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:16,149
With that, the chicken masala for the biryani is ready.

14
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:52,769
Now for the rice: I’m using 2 cups of Jeera Samba rice (short-grain aromatic rice). Wash and soak the rice before cooking.

15
00:05:53,663 --> 00:06:16,579
Add cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaf, and star anise. I’ve added about 3–4 cups of water and 1 tsp of salt. Stir well and let it come to a boil.

16
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:41,992
Once the water boils, add the soaked rice. Mix everything well. Cook until the rice is 90% done. Drain the rice and set aside. Now the biryani rice is ready.

17
00:06:46,987 --> 00:07:07,660
To layer the biryani, take a large pot and first spread the cooked chicken masala at the bottom evenly. Arrange the cooked chicken pieces neatly.

18
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:43,586
On top of the chicken, drizzle 1 tsp ghee, add chopped coriander and mint leaves, some fried onions, raisins, and cashews. This gives extra flavor and richness.

19
00:07:43,738 --> 00:08:02,199
Now add all the cooked rice on top and gently spread it. Add 1 tsp ghee, coriander, mint, fried onions, raisins, and cashews over the top.

20
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:21,454
Sprinkle some garam masala powder and saffron milk. Cover with aluminum foil tightly so no steam escapes.

21
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:47,408
Place a lid on top. Heat a pan and place the biryani pot on top. Let it cook on medium flame. Now the biryani will cook on dum for 20 minutes.

22
00:08:47,711 --> 00:09:15,556
Once done, gently scoop from the bottom to serve the chicken pieces and rice together. Garnish with fried onions, cashews, and coriander.

23
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:45,761
