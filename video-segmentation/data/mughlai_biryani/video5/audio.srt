This method makes the process really easy. It’s simple to follow and uses some special spices to make it rich and flavorful. One of our viewers requested this Mughlai Biryani recipe.

00:00:46,960 --> 00:01:13,218
We'll share some tips too. There are many types of biryanis—like Yakhni Pulao, which is different—and many others I don’t have time to name right now.

4
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:41,180
Let’s begin this perfect biryani. We've taken around 1 kg of chicken, and used golden basmati sela rice. If you’re unsure, just go with this type. I’ve soaked the rice already.

5
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:59,388
I used about 700 grams of rice and over 1 kg of chicken. We’ll also use some mint leaves, coriander leaves, cashews, almonds, raisins, and crushed ginger-garlic.

6
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:14,137
About 2 inches of ginger and 15 cloves of garlic, and lemon juice—1.5 lemons. We also need 200g curd and 100g cream, and 3 medium tomatoes.

7
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:43,567
We can easily make this using homemade spices—no need for any special store-bought ones. Just pick a good brand if buying. We’ll use salt based on the chicken quantity.

8
00:02:43,567 --> 00:03:01,926
We’re also using 2 star anise, 2 cinnamon sticks, and 4 cloves. Around 1 tablespoon of green cardamom powder. Now we’ll marinate the chicken.

9
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:28,842
We’ll mix everything well. Add mint, coriander, and some onions. This saves time during cooking.

10
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:54,745
We’ll also add crushed garlic—not paste—and lemon juice. Mix everything well with hands and let it rest for half an hour.

11
00:03:56,617 --> 00:04:25,492
We don’t need water here because the chicken releases moisture. Meanwhile, boil water for the rice and add whole spices to it for flavor.

12
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:53,588
We’ll boil extra water—enough for 1 kg of rice. Keep in mind we’ll drain this rice later. Once boiling, add the soaked rice.

13
00:04:54,701 --> 00:05:21,279
The tomatoes should be cooked until they melt and the oil separates. Let’s check—it’s nicely cooked and the oil is releasing.

14
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:55,536
Now mix the marinated chicken into the tomato mixture. It’s already releasing some boil. We'll reduce the flame and let it cook on low.

15
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:26,317
We’ll keep stirring and cooking on low flame for 5-minute intervals until the chicken is fully cooked and the moisture evaporates.

16
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:54,278
Once the water dries up, you’ll notice the aroma coming through—that means it’s nearly ready.

17
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:12,824
The water has dried up completely.

18
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:41,392
Now the masala is fragrant and the base is ready for layering.

19
00:07:42,658 --> 00:08:11,482
It has been roasted well—the masala looks perfect and aromatic.

20
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:27,682
Now that it's cooked, we’ll layer it with rice. We’ve drained the boiled rice and will start with one layer.

21
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:54,630
Place the rice in a separate pot for layering. We already added one base layer earlier. Now add golden fried onions.

22
00:08:55,407 --> 00:09:22,659
Spread evenly. You can add them directly or like this. Then add the chicken masala in a single, even layer—not too thick.

23
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:59,633
Next, add fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves again, and more chicken masala as needed.

24
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:24,894
The chicken is so aromatic and ready. This is the perfect marinated Mughlai Biryani. Add a final rice layer, and place any remaining chicken on top.

25
00:10:48,605 --> 00:11:17,697
Now we’ll add saffron milk and food color. Only saffron might not give a strong color, so I’ve added both. You can use just saffron if you want.

26
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:38,200
Keep a few cashews and raisins aside for garnish. Add 3-4 tablespoons of ghee as tadka from a small pan. Add the rest of the garnish.

27
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:53,658
Seal the pot tightly so no steam escapes. I’m doing this with dough now. After that, we’ll cover it properly.

28
00:11:54,028 --> 00:12:10,432
You can use dough around the edges for sealing.

29
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:39,591
There are many ways to seal it—it doesn’t really matter which as long as no steam escapes and the rice cooks well.

30
00:12:39,591 --> 00:13:00,043
The dum (steam) cooking is done. The rice is cooked beautifully and the biryani is ready.

31
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:28,225
This Mughlai Biryani turns out really special and delicious.
