Hello food lovers! You've been requesting this for a while — here's the Srikanth-style Chicken Mughlai Biryani recipe.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,400
Add Mughlai masala paste in your usual quantity.

3
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,540
Add two tablespoons of red chili powder.

4
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:25,520
Add about two tablespoons of ginger garlic paste.

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,540
Squeeze lemon juice and massage the mixture well into the meat.

6
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:39,060
Make sure the meat pieces are all of even size.

7
00:01:39,060 --> 00:02:09,040
Soak saffron in milk for about 30 minutes and set it aside.

8
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Now add some ghee, and it’s time for the Mughlai biryani's royal ingredients — about 20 pistachios, and more.

9
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:58,240
Pour in about half a cup of oil. It's okay to use the oil left from frying onions.

10
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,860
Mix everything really well so that the oil blends evenly.

11
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:39,040
Stir well to make sure the oil and masala are well combined.

12
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,880
Next, in a separate vessel, pour three liters of water — one liter per glass.

13
00:03:45,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Add 5 cloves, 4 cardamoms, 1 inch cinnamon stick, a mace flower, a star anise, and a cup of coriander.

14
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Squeeze the juice of one lemon into this and cover with a lid. Let it come to a boil on high flame for 6 minutes.

15
00:04:45,880 --> 00:05:01,220
Once the rice is partially cooked, layer the first half at the bottom of the biryani vessel.

16
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:11,960
Top it with some crispy fried onions.

17
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:41,940
Add fresh coriander and mint leaves evenly.

18
00:05:41,960 --> 00:06:11,940
Sprinkle more coriander and mint — add as per your preference.

19
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:41,940
Repeat layering with coriander and mint again.

20
00:06:41,960 --> 00:07:11,940
Add some more layers with the same herbs.

21
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:41,940
Add the final touches with fresh herbs on top.

22
00:07:41,960 --> 00:08:11,940
Sprinkle a bit more if you'd like the flavor to be intense.

23
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:41,940
Final herb garnishing — and you're done!
