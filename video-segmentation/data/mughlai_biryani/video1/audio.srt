Hello everyone, welcome to Home Cooking with me, Hema Subramanian. Chicken biryani is a go-to dish for most chicken lovers. There are several varieties, and today I'm sharing a special one — Mughlai Chicken Dum Biryani. It’s mild, rich, and very tasty. So let's get started!

2
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:50,707
There are three main steps: marination (the key), cooking the basmati rice, and finally layering everything together and placing it on dum. I’ll show you everything in detail — follow along closely.

3
00:00:50,707 --> 00:01:14,382
For this biryani, I've taken 2 kilos of chicken cut into large biryani pieces. First step — marinate the chicken. I've taken the juice of 3 small lemons.

4
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:39,069
Add 3 tbsp ginger garlic paste, 300 g curd, and 3 tsp salt (adjust to taste). Mix the chicken pieces well. Now add the spice powders: 1 tsp turmeric, 4 tsp chili powder,

5
00:01:40,927 --> 00:02:07,706
1 tsp pepper, 3 tsp coriander powder, 3 tsp cumin powder, and 2 tsp garam masala. Mix everything step by step to ensure the chicken is coated well with the masala.

6
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:28,969
Add whole spices: cinnamon, 12 cloves, 7 green cardamom, 3 black cardamom, 3 pieces of mace (javitri), 3 star anise, 3 marathi moggu, 1.5 tsp shahi jeera, and 3 bay leaves.

7
00:02:34,555 --> 00:03:02,568
Add 2 tbsp onion-fried oil, 2 tbsp ghee, and 4 large chopped green chilies. Add one large bowl of fried onions (crispy). Add a small bunch of mint leaves.

8
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:27,508
Mint and coriander are essential for flavor. Massage the masala well into the chicken so it absorbs everything. Now add 2 tbsp fresh cream.

9
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:56,804
Add saffron milk with saffron strands, 1/4 cup sliced almonds, 1/4 cup chopped cashews, and 1/4 cup chopped pistachios. This enriches the Mughlai biryani and gives it a royal touch.

10
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:26,487
The marinade looks rich and beautiful. Cover and let it sit for at least 2 hours (or overnight). For rice, take 1 kg whole grain basmati rice. Wash well and soak for 1 hour.

11
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:59,848
Boil a large pot of water. Add cinnamon, cloves, 5 cardamom, 2 star anise, 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp shahi jeera, coriander leaves, and mint leaves. Let the water absorb the flavors.

12
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:07,307
After 2–3 minutes, add the soaked rice gradually.

13
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:35,422
Add 3 tsp salt and the juice of 1 small lemon. This prevents the rice from breaking and keeps it fluffy. Cook the rice in two stages: remove some at 60% doneness for layering.

14
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:54,035
60% cooked rice will feel slightly crunchy. Remove it and set aside. Continue cooking the rest until 80% done, then strain and set it aside.

15
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:20,478
You can see the 60% rice — just firm enough. The 80% rice will cook fully on dum. Avoid overcooking.

16
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:37,370
Now for the final step — layering. Heat a large pot on a tawa. Add 2 tbsp ghee and 2 tbsp onion-fried oil.

17
00:06:37,370 --> 00:07:00,370
Once heated, add the marinated chicken pieces. Keep the flame high. Close the pot for 2–3 minutes to get the heat going. The chicken is starting to cook.

18
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:23,658
Now add the first layer: 60% cooked rice. Spread evenly. Add fried onions, coriander, mint, and 1 tsp ghee.

19
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:49,848
Drizzle saffron water. Add the second layer: 80% cooked rice. Spread evenly. Add 2 tsp ghee, more saffron water, and fried onions on top.

20
00:07:52,024 --> 00:08:12,915
Add coriander and mint. Cover with foil. If no foil, seal edges with dough. Keep the flame high and place a lid. Let it cook on dum for 45 minutes.

21
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:43,155
After 45 minutes, remove the foil. The aroma is incredible! Look at that beautiful biryani — chicken is soft and perfectly cooked.

22
00:08:43,611 --> 00:09:06,393
Before serving, mix gently from the bottom without breaking the rice. Look at the color, texture, and perfectly cooked rice and chicken. Serve with raita and boiled eggs.

23
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:30,337
This is a must-try recipe! I’ve shown you all the steps. It’s perfect for family feasts, get-togethers, and special occasions. The chicken is tender and flavorful.

24
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:59,953
We’ve made this rich, royal Mughlai Chicken Dum Biryani — a complete feast. Pair it with raita, chicken salna, or a simple salad. Try it, enjoy it, and share with loved ones.
