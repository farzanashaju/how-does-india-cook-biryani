Today's recipe is a special biryani. I'm going to make a very popular Sindhi Biryani from Pakistan. This biryani is quite different in preparation and taste from the ones we usually make in Kerala. Before we begin, please don't forget to subscribe to the channel. First, heat a pan and add 1 cup of ghee. When the ghee is hot, add 2 shallots and fry them.

Now the rice is half-cooked. You can pour it over the chicken mixture. The chicken has been cooking for about 10 minutes. Let’s open the lid. The chicken is now well cooked. Add the fried tomato pieces on top. Then add lemon slices, coriander leaves, and mint leaves.
