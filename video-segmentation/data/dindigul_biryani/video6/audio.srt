Hello friends! Welcome to Suna Saapi Kitchen. How are you all? I hope you're doing well. Today on our channel, we're going to see how to make Dindigul Thalappakatti-style mutton biryani just like in restaurants.

00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:50,892
Not only that, but I’ve uploaded many types of biryani recipes on our channel. I've already uploaded the Dindigul Thalappakatti mutton biryani. All the links are in the description. Make sure to check them out.

00:00:50,892 --> 00:01:17,891
The measurements I'm using for this Thalappakatti biryani are perfect. Please measure accurately. For this video, I’ve taken meat sufficient for three servings. You can see the meat I’ve used has nice fat marbling.

4
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:41,534
Maratti mokku is a very important ingredient for this biryani, so don’t skip it. Just one star anise, a little bit of nutmeg, two pieces of kalpasi (stone flower), and a quarter piece of mace – these are essential.

5
00:01:41,534 --> 00:02:10,542
These are the main ingredients. Don't reduce or skip them. We’re going to grind this masala fresh. Keep the masala aside for now, and later we’ll make it into a paste.

6
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:39,127
For this mutton biryani, I’ve taken 1.3 kg of mutton. Wash the mutton thoroughly. We'll pressure cook it, so use a cooker that's suitable for the quantity.

7
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:58,027
Cook it for about 5-6 whistles. Only mutton is needed here for tempering. Mutton is all we need. Mutton is all we need. (repeated unintelligibly)

8
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:21,551
I’ve used only a quarter piece of nutmeg – don't add more, or the biryani will become bitter. Now we’ll add our ground masala with cashews. Keep it ready.

9
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:38,629
This biryani has a traditional and authentic appearance.

10
00:03:38,629 --> 00:04:07,282
Jeeraga samba rice is typically used – it gives the best taste. I’ve also used that here. Wash and soak the rice well before use. I’ve taken 1.3 kg of rice.

11
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:29,963
Now that the biryani setup is ready, let’s start tempering it. I’m using a heavy-bottomed pan. I’ve added groundnut oil instead of sunflower oil. It gives better flavor.

12
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:57,858
After adding water, cover with a lid. When the water boils, it can splash up and cause issues, so covering it prevents mess and lets it cook evenly and quietly.

13
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:19,507
You might wonder how much water to add – break the dried red chilies and add water (repeats phrase multiple times).

14
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:37,226
Now add the paste we prepared – ginger-garlic paste, coriander, mint, green chili, and shallots. If you have big onions, chop them and add too.

15
00:05:37,226 --> 00:06:06,978
After adding the ginger-garlic paste, sauté it for 5-7 minutes until the oil separates – that’s the right consistency. Then add ¾ bunch each of coriander and mint.

16
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:35,446
After sautéing the herbs, add the cooked mutton (without any water). Sauté the mutton for 5 minutes until it slightly changes color.

17
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:51,358
After sautéing for about 5 minutes, now it’s time to add the ground masala paste. I’ve added around two tablespoons of the entire ground paste.

18
00:06:51,358 --> 00:07:11,524
If you’ve ground a lot, just add 2 tablespoons and save the rest. As soon as you add it, you’ll get an amazing aroma.

19
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:36,887
According to your spice level, adjust the red chili powder. I’ve added 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder.

20
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:53,019
Let everything cook well and blend. Now, we’ll add yogurt. I’ve added about 2 cups of yogurt.

21
00:07:53,019 --> 00:08:20,509
Add the yogurt (repeats several times).

22
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:28,642
Add coriander and mint again (repeats several times).

23
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:57,753
Now we’ve added yogurt, chili, tomato – everything is mixed well. You’ll know it’s ready when the oil separates and it smells amazing.

24
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:26,827
I’ve added enough water for 2 cups of rice. Since the masala doesn’t have much liquid, I added extra water accordingly. The rice-to-water ratio is 1:1.

25
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:47,044
If you're using old rice, it absorbs more water. If you're using new rice, it doesn't need as much. Adjust water accordingly.

26
00:09:47,044 --> 00:10:10,940
Even after adding the rice, keep adjusting and checking the water level (repeats several times).

27
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:31,004
Stir everything and mix well (repeats "water" multiple times again).

28
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:55,118
Again, mix it all well. The water level should be appropriate. But if you're using basmati rice, don’t mix like this – be gentle.

29
00:10:55,118 --> 00:11:13,850
The water is just right now. Time to put it on *dum* (slow steam cooking). I’ve added 3 tablespoons of ghee. Cover with banana leaf if available, then seal with foil.

30
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:35,956
Preheat an old dosa tawa (griddle), place the biryani pot on top, and cook on medium-low flame for 20 minutes. Then turn off the flame and leave it for another 10 minutes.

31
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:54,889
After 10 minutes, turn off the stove. It will stay warm for some time.

32
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:19,898
Now I’m mixing the rice gently. I’m placing it on banana leaves again to finish off the dum process. Thalappakatti mutton biryani gets its real flavor from this.

33
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:49,294
Again, seal and leave it like this for another half an hour. Place a heavy utensil on top. After 30 minutes, you can open it. You’ll see the rice is perfectly cooked.

34
00:12:49,294 --> 00:13:10,456
The rice is fluffy, perfectly cooked and separate. It looks amazing and is perfect to serve. You can pair it with mango pickle, brinjal curry, fried chilies, and dalcha.

35
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:29,304
I’ve also made banana stem salad, rasagulla, mango, onion raita, and payasam. When served together, it tastes just like wedding biryani. Dindigul Thalappakatti mutton biryani is absolutely delicious.

00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:48,695
