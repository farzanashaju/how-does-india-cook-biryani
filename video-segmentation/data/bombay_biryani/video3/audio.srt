Assalamualaikum, welcome to Home Cooking Point. Today we’re going to share the recipe of Shan Bombay Biryani Masala with you. This biryani is very quick to make and turns out very delicious. Follow my recipe step...

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:52,781
So let’s begin. We’ve taken 1 cup of yogurt here. Now we’ll add the Shan Bombay Biryani Masala packet into it. We’ll add the entire packet as we’re making 1 kg of biryani. Now we’ll mix it well...

3
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:23,561
We’ll add a few more spices into it. We have coriander powder here. 1 tablespoon red chili powder. ½ teaspoon turmeric powder. ½ teaspoon garam masala powder. Now we’ll mix it all well...

4
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:53,515
After mixing, we’ll set it aside. We’re making 1 kg of biryani, so we’ve added some whole spices as well. Everything is mixed well. Now we’ll keep this aside. Let’s move on...

5
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:20,870
We’ve taken 3 medium-sized potatoes, cut like this. Now we’ll fry them. Our potatoes are nicely fried now. We’ll take them out.

6
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:57,961
The potatoes are fried. We’ve taken them out. Now we’ll add 1 tablespoon of whole garam masala — one star anise, one black cardamom, a cinnamon stick, 3–4 cloves, 5 black peppers, and 3 green cardamoms...

7
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:14,836
We’ve taken 1 kg of chicken. Now we’ll add the chicken into it.

8
00:03:54,474 --> 00:04:17,257
Now we’ll mix it well and fry until the chicken changes color. See, we’ve roasted it well for 3–4 minutes. Now we’ll add 4 tablespoons of ginger garlic paste...

9
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:31,937
Add 1 teaspoon of salt and roast it well until the raw smell of the ginger is gone.

10
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:54,786
We’ve roasted the ginger-garlic paste. Now we’ll add tomatoes.

11
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:34,189
Now we’ll add the Shan Bombay Biryani masala mix that we prepared with yogurt. At this stage, you can taste and adjust salt and chili as per your preference. We’ll also add the fried potatoes now.

12
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:55,790
Now mix everything well, cover, and cook for 10 minutes on medium flame so the masala cooks properly. Cover and cook on medium flame for 10 minutes.

13
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:28,627
It’s been 10 minutes. Our masala is perfectly cooked. Now we’ll add 1 cup of brown fried onions. We had prepared these earlier. If you don’t have them ready...

14
00:06:45,283 --> 00:07:07,458
We’ve added 1 cup of brown onions. We had browned 4–5 medium-sized onions. The recipe for fried onions is on our channel. You can check the link in the description box.

15
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:43,012
Now we’ll add a little fresh coriander and mix it well. Then we’ll cover and cook it for 5 minutes on medium flame.

16
00:07:43,839 --> 00:08:03,144
5 minutes have passed, let’s check the masala. It smells amazing. Our korma is ready. Turn off the gas and set it aside. Now we’ll boil the rice for the biryani.

17
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:39,932
We’ve taken 3–4 liters of water to boil the rice — that’s about 10–12 glasses. Into this, add a cinnamon stick, ½ teaspoon cumin seeds, some curry leaves, and a little...

18
00:08:42,480 --> 00:09:09,919
We’ve taken juice of one lemon — add that too. Instead of lemon juice, you can also use vinegar. (Repeated many times unnecessarily in original.)

19
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:32,296
See, the water is boiling. Now we’ll add the rice. We’ve taken 1 kg of basmati rice and soaked it an hour earlier. Now we’ll add it — this is 4 cups of rice.

20
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:55,751
Mix it well and cook it 80% — the grains should still have a slight bite.

21
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:30,734
The rice is 80% cooked now. Turn off the gas, strain the rice, and begin layering the biryani in the same pot we boiled the rice in. First, drizzle a bit of oil...

22
00:10:46,933 --> 00:11:14,034
Now we’ll add a layer of rice. After the rice layer, we’ll add a layer of the korma.

23
00:11:32,158 --> 00:12:01,706
We’ve added the korma layer. Now we’ll add fresh coriander and mint. We’ve cut green chilies in half and added them. Now we’ll add fried onions. Next comes the second layer of rice.

24
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:34,613
We’ve added the second rice layer. Now we’ll add another layer of korma. That makes two layers total. Then again add coriander, mint, and fried onions. Now on top...

25
00:12:35,591 --> 00:13:03,048
We’ll add the final rice layer. We’ve added the final rice layer. Now we’ll add yellow food color and 1 tablespoon of kewra water. Add fried onions on top...

26
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:37,658
A bit more coriander and mint leaves on top. Now cover and steam (dum) the biryani for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes of dum, the biryani is completely ready. Now we’ll...

27
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:58,684
See how perfectly the biryani turned out. The aroma is amazing, and the rice is perfectly fluffy and separate.

28
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:24,384
Now we’ll serve it. Look how wonderful our Shan Bombay Biryani has turned out. The rice is perfectly cooked and separate, just like the biryani you get at restaurants.

29
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:46,070
