Assalamualaikum everyone, how are you all? I hope you all are doing well. Welcome to my channel. Today again I’ve brought a very amazing recipe for you. Today I am making Chicken Bombay Biryani with Shan’s Special Bombay Biryani Masala.

2
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:53,204
It turns out very tangy, very spicy, and extremely delicious. I will share the entire procedure with you step-by-step. My recipe is a bit different from the one mentioned on the box. You can watch the video...

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:11,986
For the biryani, first I will soak the rice for half an hour. I’ve taken good-quality basmati rice here, about half a kilogram. I’ll wash them properly and then soak for 30 minutes.

4
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:32,218
Apart from that, the ingredients we’ll need include onions. I’ve taken three large-sized onions and finely sliced them. And we’ll need 3 tablespoons of ginger-garlic paste. I’ve also taken dry plums (alu bukhara)...

5
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:51,305
I’ve taken half a cup of cooking oil. You’ll need Shan’s Bombay Biryani Masala – a little more than half a pack. I’ve taken a handful of mint leaves and some coriander. Take 4-5 green chilies too.

6
00:01:51,305 --> 00:02:10,457
I’m using two medium-sized potatoes – optional – if you like potatoes in your biryani, you can add them; otherwise, skip them. I’ve also taken half a kilogram of chicken and a bit of salt. Now first, in the pan...

7
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:30,032
(Filler audio, unclear) – repeated "aapko" phrases, possibly a glitch or loop in the video.

8
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:54,433
Don’t let the onions get too dark, otherwise, the gravy or korma will turn too dark in color. As soon as the onions are fried, I added the chicken, potatoes, and ginger-garlic paste. I added all these together, and now we’ll fry them.

9
00:02:55,193 --> 00:03:14,194
Perfectly fried chicken is golden on the outside but juicy and soft on the inside. The tip is: when frying chicken in oil, fry it covered at intervals – you can keep covering and uncovering it with a lid.

10
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:44,114
Then fry it a little more and cover again. I do this 2–3 times. This way, the chicken turns out very soft and tender on the inside. Definitely try this trick. You will...

11
00:03:45,801 --> 00:04:03,723
Along with the tomatoes, I added Shan’s Special Bombay Biryani Masala. I used half a pack plus one tablespoon. You can increase the quantity if you like spicier biryani. But for half a kg of rice...

12
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:17,863
Now again, I’m mixing it a little, and after mixing, I’ll cover it for 5–7 minutes so the tomatoes soften well. After that, we’ll sauté it (do the “bhunai”).

13
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:46,314
The tomatoes softened nicely, and then I fried it for 3–4 more minutes. At this stage, I’ll remove all the cardamom. Cardamom doesn’t taste good when it comes into the mouth while eating biryani.

14
00:04:46,314 --> 00:05:15,172
Apart from that, I’ve added dry plums (alu bukhara). I love them in biryani. If you don’t, you can skip them or add tamarind instead. Now again we’ll add yogurt and dry plums...

15
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:35,742
...in a wide vessel so the rice turns out fluffy and separate. I added around 2 liters of water in the wide vessel. I’ve added salt. You need to add a bit more salt than usual because the rice...

16
00:05:35,742 --> 00:06:01,173
So I’ve added salt. I also added one stick of cinnamon, one teaspoon of white vinegar, and a handful of mint leaves. Then I waited for it to come to a boil. Once it started boiling, I added the rice.

17
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:30,485
Now the next process is very simple – we’ll do the biryani layering. First, I added the masala in the pot, and then I added a layer of rice. On top of that goes the chicken layer. I’m doing a single layer here...

18
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:49,569
Mint, mint, mint, mint, mint, mint, mint, mint, mint. (Likely showing repeated addition of mint leaves visually.)

19
00:06:49,569 --> 00:07:17,497
If the bottom of your pot is thick, you don’t need to put a tawa (griddle) under it. But if the bottom is not that thick... (repeats for emphasis or clarification)

20
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:37,833
Each grain of rice is separate and fluffy. The taste of this biryani is amazing – absolutely delicious. Just like the biryani you get at restaurants – tangy, spicy, and full of flavor – that’s how it turns out with Shan’s Special Bombay Biryani Masala.
