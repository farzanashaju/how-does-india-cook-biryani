Today I’m going to show you how to make this amazing recipe – Lucknowi Chicken Biryani. So you must learn how to make it. Watch the full video. The first thing you need to do is soak the rice.

2
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:51,567
After soaking 1 kg of rice, wash it thoroughly. Meanwhile, take some saffron strands and mix them in 3 tablespoons of milk. See this – let it soak well.

3
00:00:56,377 --> 00:01:26,076
After slicing onions, place your preferred cooking pot on the stove and pour in half a cup of oil. Once the oil heats up, add the sliced onions. Look at this – fry the onions until they turn golden brown.

4
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:46,612
(Additional lines unclear/repetitive – skipping for clarity.)

5
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:22,033
Now add 8 green cardamoms and 6 cloves. Then add ginger garlic paste. Cook the paste really well to remove the raw smell.

6
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:56,560
Now add red chili powder – keep stirring well. (Note: The line repeats "aloo chili powder" – likely a mis-speak of "lal mirch" (red chili)).

7
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:20,388
Turn the flame low. Add 200 grams of whisked curd/yogurt. Stir it gently and let it cook nicely.

8
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:58,002
Now add a pinch of mace powder, half a teaspoon cardamom powder, and a pinch of nutmeg powder. Mix it all in gently. When you see a nice sheen in the chicken, move to the next step.

9
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:28,968
Cook it for a while until the chicken is 80–90% cooked – no more than that. As you can see, the chicken is beautifully cooked now. And the gravy you see here is very important.

10
00:04:31,161 --> 00:05:00,119
Now we strain the yakhni (stock). Look at this – it smells amazing! Use a strainer to collect all the aromatic yakhni into a bowl.

11
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:29,937
Now extract the 'rogan' (flavored oil/fat). Do this as I’m showing you – collect it in a bowl. Then add 2 tablespoons of ghee into the rogan, mix it well, and keep it aside. We’ll use it later.

12
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:54,980
Now add cinnamon powder, a pinch of mace powder, half teaspoon cardamom powder, a pinch of nutmeg, 1 tbsp kewra water, 1 tbsp rose water, 100g milk, and 100g fresh cream. Mix this well.

13
00:05:55,672 --> 00:06:13,069
Now add 5–6 liters of water in a large vessel. Add 8–10 green cardamoms, 2 cinnamon sticks, 2 bay leaves, 7–8 cloves, and at least 3–4 tablespoons of salt.

14
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:40,237
Add plenty of salt – it's important. Then add 4 tablespoons of desi ghee. While the water is heating, strain the soaked rice. Once the water is boiling, squeeze the juice of a lemon into it.

15
00:06:43,528 --> 00:07:10,377
You can now remove the whole spices if you prefer, or leave them in – your choice. Now turn the flame high and boil the rice. Our rice is now cooked properly.

16
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:39,014
Now lift the pot and strain all the rice thoroughly as shown. Take the vessel in which you'll layer the biryani. Add 2 tablespoons of ghee and coat the bottom.

17
00:07:40,786 --> 00:08:05,170
Now layer the strained rice, followed by the cooked chicken. Then pour the yakhni (flavored stock) evenly on top, and add the remaining rice over that.

18
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:36,288
Gently layer everything. Now pour the remaining yakhni around the sides. Then add the saffron milk we soaked earlier – this is going to be magical.

19
00:08:37,317 --> 00:09:06,932
Now pour the reserved rogan on top. Then add 3 drops of meetha ittar (sweet edible essence), 2 pinches of cardamom powder, 1 pinch nutmeg powder, 2 pinches of cinnamon powder, and 1 pinch of mace powder.

20
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:22,153
Cover the pot tightly, as I’m showing you, and seal it. Then keep it on low flame and cook on dum (slow steam) for 15–20 minutes.

21
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:52,697
First, cook on high flame for 2 minutes to generate steam inside. Then lower the flame completely and let it cook for 15 minutes on dum.

22
00:09:53,052 --> 00:10:20,996
25 minutes have passed, and the biryani has been beautifully cooked on dum. I’m taking it to the table to show you how stunning it looks. Hold your heart – it’s going to be impressive!

23
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:50,950
Look at this – every grain of rice is separate and has amazing color. The saffron and rogan have given it a royal touch. This is a biryani you can count every grain of!

24
00:10:51,625 --> 00:11:13,933
Now see how to serve it – gently lift it like this. Look at that color! Serve it on a plate. I’ll say it again – every grain of rice is distinct, and the aroma is just divine, beyond words!
