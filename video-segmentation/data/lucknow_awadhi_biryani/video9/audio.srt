00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:40,716
So let’s get started. But before that, I request you to please subscribe to my channel, like the video, and don’t forget to share it.

3
00:00:54,857 --> 00:01:22,685
So viewers, for mutton biryani we’ll need 1 kg of long grain basmati rice which we’ll soak for half an hour. We've taken 700 grams of meat and washed it well. We need 2 teaspoons of ginger paste and 2 teaspoons of garlic paste.

4
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:54,746
We'll need 100 grams of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 100 grams of fresh cream. Add salt to taste. We’ll also use half a teaspoon of edible yellow food color.

5
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:24,801
We’ll take a pinch of saffron. 2 teaspoons of red chili powder. 2 teaspoons of cardamom and mace powder. And we’ll need 200 ml of milk. Also, we’ll need 150 ml of oil.

6
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:47,599
We’ll also need 2 tablespoons of desi ghee. For aroma, we’ll use kewra water, rose water, or rose gel, and edible sweet essence.

7
00:02:51,159 --> 00:03:16,522
So viewers, our ingredients are ready. Let’s begin making the mutton biryani. For whole spices, we’ll need 8-10 green cardamoms, 8-10 cloves, and one bay leaf. Take a pan and place it on high flame. Once the oil heats up, add the onions.

8
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:40,840
We’ll sauté the onions until they turn light golden brown. Keep stirring continuously to avoid burning. See, the onions have started to turn golden. Now we’ll add the meat.

9
00:03:48,568 --> 00:04:15,264
We need to fry the meat well in oil. Now we’ll add 3-4 small cardamoms and cloves. I’ve kept the flame high.

10
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:44,273
The meat has been fried well and changed color. Now we’ll add the spices — add 2 teaspoons of ginger paste. You can reduce the flame if needed.

11
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:58,786
Add 2 teaspoons of garlic paste and mix it well.

12
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:32,333
Sauté this mixture for 2-3 minutes. After that, add red chili powder. You can add more if you like it spicy. Then we’ll add around 3 teaspoons of salt. You can taste and adjust later.

13
00:05:33,649 --> 00:06:01,307
Now we’ll add about 1 teaspoon of cardamom and mace powder. Mix and keep sautéing. We’ve lowered the flame to avoid burning. Now we’ll add yogurt.

14
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:28,797
Take about 100 grams of yogurt, approximately 4-5 tablespoons. After frying the yogurt properly, we’ll add 3 drops of edible sweet essence. Mix it well.

15
00:06:33,978 --> 00:07:00,521
We’ve added all the spices. Now we’ll add one cup of water. Since we need to cook the meat, we’ve added 200–250 ml of water. Cover with a lid and cook on low flame for 15–20 minutes. Viewers, if you want...

16
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:31,454
Now we’ll take another pot with 4 liters of water and add 5–6 tablespoons of salt. Also add cloves and cardamom. Bring it to a boil, and once it boils, we’ll add the rice which we had soaked earlier.

17
00:07:33,225 --> 00:08:03,060
We’ll cover it and let it come to a boil. Meanwhile, let’s check the biryani gravy to see if the meat is tender. It’s been around 20 minutes. The spices have released oil. First, let’s check the meat for doneness.

18
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:32,120
The biryani masala is perfectly ready now. We’ll switch off the flame and keep it covered for 10 minutes. Viewers, now I’m going to share a very important step that makes Lucknowi mutton biryani truly unique.

19
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:59,407
Watch this step carefully as it is key. First, we’ll separate all the oil into a bowl. Then, in the next step, we’ll take the mutton pieces out separately — not the masala, just the pieces.

20
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:33,966
We’ve taken out all the meat pieces. Now take a large bowl in which we’ll prepare the biryani gravy. Transfer the masala into this bowl. We’ve separated the oil and the mutton pieces. Now in this masala...

21
00:09:39,855 --> 00:10:07,109
We’ll add 1 teaspoon of cardamom and mace powder. Then add 1 teaspoon of sugar. After that, add salt.

22
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:33,990
We’ve added 1 teaspoon of salt. We’ll check later and adjust if needed. Now add fresh cream. Then add 2 teaspoons of kewra water.

23
00:10:37,484 --> 00:11:04,669
You can easily find kewra water anywhere. After that, add 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of rose water.

24
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:33,711
So our gravy is almost ready. Now we’ll add the saffron that we soaked in a spoon of water. Mix everything well. Then I added half a teaspoon of red chili powder.

25
00:11:34,116 --> 00:12:03,057
You can add 1 to 1.5 teaspoons if you like it spicier. We don’t eat very spicy, so I’m using less. Now take the oil we had separated from the gravy, and add 3 drops of edible sweet essence to it.

26
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:31,035
Then add 2 tablespoons of desi ghee. The mutton biryani masala is completely ready. Now add the mutton pieces to this gravy.

27
00:12:37,481 --> 00:13:01,360
Mix everything well. Now add the separated oil into it. Viewers, authentic Lucknowi biryani is made exactly with this kind of prepared gravy.

28
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:29,086
Let’s now check the water for rice that we kept on the stove. Yes, it’s boiling. Now add the soaked rice after draining the water.

29
00:13:33,524 --> 00:14:03,224
Mix well. If the salt seems less, you can taste and add more. Let it come to a boil again. When it boils, check the rice. It should be half-cooked, not fully done.

30
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:32,975
Now in the pot in which we’ll assemble the biryani for dum, first add a layer of rice. On top of the rice, add the biryani masala. Place all the meat pieces and half of the gravy.

31
00:14:45,259 --> 00:15:14,284
As you can see, we’ve added all the pieces on the first layer. Now pour half of the gravy evenly over this layer. Then add another layer of rice on top and pour the remaining gravy over it evenly.

32
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:40,238
Now add the remaining rice as the final top layer. Spread it evenly. Then mix the yellow food color with 2 tablespoons of water and pour it over the rice like this.

33
00:15:48,591 --> 00:16:13,955
Now we’ll put the biryani on dum. First place it on high flame for 5 minutes with the lid on. After 5 minutes, reduce the flame and place a tawa underneath the pot.

34
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:46,692
Viewers, placing the tawa prevents the biryani from burning at the bottom. Cook on medium flame for 5 minutes, then lower the flame for 10 more minutes. Then switch off the gas. The biryani is on dum now.

35
00:16:48,802 --> 00:17:15,785
Alright viewers, 30 minutes have passed. Let’s open the biryani. The rice is perfectly cooked and the aroma is amazing. It looks beautiful too. Each grain of rice is separate and fluffy.

36
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:44,084
Viewers, the whole house is filled with the aroma of biryani and everyone is excited to eat it. While serving, be gentle so that the rice grains don’t break. Serve it from one side carefully.

37
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:23,587
So viewers, the Lucknowi mutton biryani is ready. Serve it with yogurt raita and salad. Do make this biryani on special occasions and don’t forget to share this recipe with your friends and relatives.
