Today we’re making Lucknowi Chicken Biryani, also known as Awadhi Chicken Biryani. It’s a lightly spiced biryani with a very rich flavor. First, we’ll take half a cup of oil.

2
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:48,158
We’ll lightly fry the onions to golden. Once they are fried, add 1 kg chicken. As soon as we add it, increase the flame to high and mix the chicken well with the oil. Fry it nicely on high flame.

3
00:00:49,070 --> 00:01:13,689
Add 5 cloves. With just these whole spices, we'll roast the chicken until the raw smell of ginger-garlic goes away. Continue mixing on high flame. This biryani uses yellow chili powder which adds excellent flavor.

4
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:35,611
Add 2 tbsp of yellow chili powder and 1 tbsp of red chili powder. Mix the chicken well with these spices for 1 to 1.5 minutes. Now reduce the flame to low and add 3/4 cup of whisked curd — about 150 grams.

5
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:52,908
To make biryani masala, take 10g green cardamom, 10g mace (javitri), and half a nutmeg. Grind them into a fine aromatic powder. Add ½ tsp of this biryani masala into the pan.

6
00:01:53,278 --> 00:02:14,152
Now mix the curd thoroughly with the chicken. Once it is well mixed, increase the flame again. Once the chicken boils nicely, add about half a cup of water. Let it cook well.

7
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:41,338
Add 3–4 drops of sweet ittar (aromatic essence). Cover and cook the chicken for at least 15 minutes on medium to low flame. Cook it 80–90% through. The rest will cook with the rice later.

8
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:49,507
Now strain the broth (yakhni) properly. Squeeze out all the flavor from the spices while straining.

9
00:02:50,317 --> 00:03:13,502
Now add all the fragrance: 1 tbsp kewra water, 1 tbsp rose water, 3–4 drops of sweet ittar, and 1 cup of milk to make the biryani even richer.

10
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:41,465
Mix everything well. This fragrant yakhni is now ready. Now scoop out 2–3 tablespoons of the oil or gravy (rogan) from the top. Save about 1 tbsp more for layering later.

11
00:03:41,465 --> 00:04:07,687
Add green cardamom and a bay leaf. Add 2 tbsp of salt. Also, add 2 tbsp of ghee — this makes the rice soft and rich. Squeeze in half a lemon.

12
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:16,244
Cook the rice until it is about 75% done. Use the same pot in which we prepared the chicken for layering the biryani.

13
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:39,127
Drizzle a little ghee in the base. Spread a layer of 75% cooked rice evenly. Now add the chicken. After that, pour the aromatic yakhni over it.

14
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:55,680
Drain the remaining water from the rice and layer it on top. After layering all the rice, pour the saved rogan mixture over it. Add a bit of orange food color. You can also soak saffron in milk and add that.

15
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:23,963
Cover and cook the biryani on low flame for 20–25 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the lid. This biryani doesn’t use coriander, mint leaves, or fried onions — just enjoy it as is.
