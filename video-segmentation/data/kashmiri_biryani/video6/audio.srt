We’ve taken two onions. We’ll add them and lightly brown them. Once golden, we’ll add 1 kg of chicken and fry it. The chicken will also be lightly golden.

4
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:48,048
We’ll fry the chicken for about 5 to 10 minutes. Add two spoons of ginger-garlic paste. I’ve chopped three tomatoes like this, and we’ll add them too. Let the tomatoes soften.

5
00:01:49,971 --> 00:02:14,491
The tomatoes are soft now. Add spices: half a teaspoon turmeric powder, one spoon red chili, two spoons biryani masala, one spoon salt, and half a teaspoon cumin seeds. Sauté the spices for 2-3 minutes.

6
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:42,688
Add half a cup of yogurt. It enhances the biryani’s taste. Cook until the water from the yogurt dries out. Then add half a liter of water so the chicken cooks well.

7
00:02:44,426 --> 00:03:07,698
Cover and cook until the water evaporates and the chicken is tender. Meanwhile, we’ll boil the rice. I’ve taken 2 liters of water and 1 kg of rice, soaked for 10 minutes. Add 1 spoon cumin, 1.5...

8
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:28,370
Boil the rice up to 70%. Cover it. It took about 4-5 minutes. Now we’ll drain the water and prepare for layering the rice.

9
00:03:39,828 --> 00:04:09,645
Now we’ll layer the chicken we prepared earlier. Then we’ll add a layer of rice over it.

10
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:36,747
The chicken layer is done. Now the final rice layer. I’ve cooled the rice with cold water so they don’t stick together. Add 2-3 spoons of raisins on top.

11
00:04:37,978 --> 00:05:03,646
Add one spoon of chopped coconut, 10-12 almonds with skins removed, and a pinch each of yellow, red, and green food coloring.

12
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:36,146
We haven’t turned on the flame yet. We’ve boiled 4 eggs. Slice two eggs and place them on top; reserve the other two for garnish. Now turn on the flame, cover it, and let it cook for 8 to 10 minutes.

13
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:59,214
Reduce the flame to low. The steam has risen to the top. We’ve let it simmer for 10-12 minutes. Now we’ll mix it carefully and turn off the flame. Gently fold everything together.

14
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:21,997
Now we’ll plate it.
