In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace be upon you. After a long time, I’m here to share a recipe. It's a quick and perfect biryani recipe. You can...

2
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:46,470
Always use this type of rice for biryani. It’s called Sella rice or Double Chawal rice, a type of Basmati. We measured it using this cup — we used four cups.

3
00:00:46,470 --> 00:01:14,483
Sella rice is slightly hard and doesn’t break easily. We washed it well and soaked it for one hour. Then we took 1.5 kg of chicken and...

4
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:44,537
Added 1 tsp turmeric, ½ tsp cumin, ½ tsp fennel powder, and 1½ tsp Kashmiri red chili powder. Then we added yogurt — around 250 grams — and mixed everything well.

5
00:01:44,621 --> 00:02:08,078
We'll crush whole biryani spices: nutmeg, mace, star anise — coarsely. Then we’ll prepare onions.

6
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:36,580
Fry the onions well until golden and crispy. Once done, remove them to a plate so they stay crisp.

7
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:52,358
Remove half the oil, leaving about 4–5 tablespoons in the pot. Then add the marinated chicken.

8
00:02:52,662 --> 00:03:15,814
Add the crushed spices. We're not using any store-bought powdered masala. Using whole spices gives a very rich flavor.

9
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:36,942
We’ve taken peeled tomatoes.

10
00:03:36,942 --> 00:04:01,478
Crush the tomatoes and add them to the pot. Cook until the gravy is no longer watery and oil starts separating. Stir occasionally.

11
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:21,019
Once oil separates, the chicken is well cooked. Add water, bring it to a boil, then turn off the flame.

12
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:39,514
Now for the rice water preparation...

13
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:58,144
To the water, add 5–6 green cardamoms, 2 black cardamoms, and 7–8 black peppercorns.

14
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:25,954
Add one stick of cinnamon and 5 tablespoons of salt. The salt should taste slightly more than normal. Boil until the water turns a darker shade.

15
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:55,942
Cook the rice until 80–90% done. If needed, add more salt. Some rice grains cook faster than others, so check as you go.

16
00:05:55,942 --> 00:06:10,673
Strain the rice and discard the water. Now layer the cooked chicken in the same pot.

17
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:34,449
Add the rice over the chicken. Then add the fried onions on top. We are not layering multiple times — this method is simpler and results are the same.

18
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:45,605
First, add the chicken layer, then all the rice, followed by fried onions. Then add some more rice and...

19
00:06:46,211 --> 00:07:04,927
Add 2–3 tablespoons of desi ghee and a bit of orange-red food color. This is optional but gives a market-style look and makes it more presentable.

20
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:22,122
Check the moisture level — when you insert a spoon, it should come out dry. That means it's ready for the final step.

21
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:49,713
Cover and let it simmer on low flame for 5 minutes. This helps stabilize the rice as the temperature gradually lowers. And there you have it — delicious biryani is ready.

22
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:56,007
Until the next recipe, Allah Hafiz.
