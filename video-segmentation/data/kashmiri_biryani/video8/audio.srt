00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:36,295
Today we'll show you how to make mutton biryani at home. This biryani tastes like restaurant-style, and you can see the vibrant colors in it. This recipe turns out very tasty.

3
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:53,069
If you're interested, I'll leave the link in the description box for where you can buy the ingredients. Sela rice is mostly used for biryani and pulao.

4
00:00:53,069 --> 00:01:19,933
We’ve taken one kilogram of mutton with bones. Then we have taken five large onions, finely chopped. We've used mustard oil, crushed garlic...

5
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:32,658
Then we have green chilies, black pepper, red chili powder, and salt.

6
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:57,903
Ginger-garlic paste, or you can use only garlic. Cumin seeds, cinnamon sticks, and nutmeg. Nutmeg is essential for biryani. I’ll leave a link below.

7
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:14,844
Mace is also essential for biryani. I’ll link it below. We’re also using kewra water. All of these are used in biryani: turmeric, black cardamom...

8
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:44,949
Coriander powder, and fennel powder. We’ve used oil, but you can use ghee. Then bay leaves and saffron. First, we’ll heat mustard oil in a pan until it’s hot and smoking.

9
00:02:47,582 --> 00:03:10,937
Keep some oil aside for later. We've fried the onions. In a mixer grinder, add 1 tsp cumin seeds, 2 bay leaves, 2 black cardamoms...

10
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:30,918
1 cinnamon stick, 1 nutmeg, 2 pieces of mace. Make a fine powder—this is the biryani masala we'll use for cooking.

11
00:03:32,740 --> 00:04:02,439
Now let’s marinate the mutton. Place the washed meat in a large bowl. Add 1 tsp turmeric...

12
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:27,701
1 tbsp red chili powder, salt to taste, 2 tbsp of the biryani masala we just made...

13
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:47,192
Add 250 grams of thick curd (whisk it before adding). Then 3 tbsp finely chopped coriander, and mint...

14
00:04:48,964 --> 00:05:17,887
Mix it well. Add one cup of the fried onions we prepared earlier. Crush them and mix into the marinade.

15
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:47,182
Cover and let it marinate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, we’ll prepare the rice. In a pot of water, add 15 black peppercorns, 7–8 cloves, 1 tbsp of the biryani masala...

16
00:05:47,182 --> 00:06:03,012
Boil the water with all these spices.

17
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:26,266
Once it starts boiling, add the washed sela rice. We didn’t soak the rice beforehand as it cooks quickly when added to boiling water.

18
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:49,468
Drain the rice and spread it out on a tray or strainer to cool. You can remove any visible whole spices.

19
00:06:50,009 --> 00:07:15,355
Put the marinated meat into a pressure cooker and cook it 90% through. Add a little water, not too much. Don’t fully cook it, only 90%, as this is not raw meat-style biryani.

20
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:36,279
After 2–3 whistles, it should be ready. Cooking time depends on the quality of meat. Now in a pan, we’ll start layering.

21
00:07:36,279 --> 00:08:03,634
First, a layer of cooked mutton at the bottom. Then spread a layer of rice evenly on top.

22
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:32,120
Pour some of the curry over the rice so the color and flavor spread well. Then another layer of rice goes on top. 

23
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:58,477
Drizzle milk in some places for color. You can also use food coloring optionally in a few spots.

24
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:20,585
Now we’ll put it on dum (steam cook). You can seal with a cloth or dough. First cook on high flame for 3 minutes, then lower the heat.

25
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:46,673
You can see the rice grains are fluffy, not broken, and not sticking together. The color looks great. The meat is soft and well-cooked.

26
00:09:46,673 --> 00:10:09,909
Let me show you how to garnish it. You can use a slicer to cut onions into rings. You can use a knife, but the slicer gives better thin rings.

27
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:21,688
You can garnish it however you like.
