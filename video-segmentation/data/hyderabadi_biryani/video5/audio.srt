1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
You won't find biryani like Hyderabad's anywhere in the world

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,920
And that's not a claim, it's a fact. So today

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,660
we’ll show you how to make chicken biryani

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,120
that too in authentic Hyderabadi style. First,

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,980
we’ll marinate the chicken with spices.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,840
Take chicken and add lemon

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,740
juice, ginger-garlic paste, green chili, red chili,

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,960
turmeric, salt, whole spices,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,240
black pepper, rose petals, and fried onions

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,220
which we had already prepared. Then add

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,980
yogurt, mint, coriander, and green chilies.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,840
Mix it all thoroughly, then

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,880
add oil, mix well, and let it marinate

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,980
for an hour. Now in a pot,

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,020
take water and add coarse salt, whole

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,880
spices, squeeze a lemon and add its

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
peels too. Then add green chilies,

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
coriander, mint, and oil. After that,

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
bring it to a good boil. Then,

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,100
add the basmati rice that has been

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,440
soaked for an hour. Cook the rice until it's 60% done.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,420
Now take the marinated chicken and place it

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,160
in a large pot. Add a little water from the rice

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
and layer 60% cooked rice on top. Then take the

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,219
remaining rice, cook it 80% through, and make a

26
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,020
nice top layer. Then we’ll add

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,000
fried onions on top,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,040
mint, coriander, and this is saffron milk.

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,220
This is kewra water and rose water. Finally,

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,200
we’ll add pure ghee. Take a pan,

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,939
place it on the stove, and keep the biryani pot on it.

32
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,920
Wrap the lid with a cloth and seal the pot for

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,960
dum (slow cooking). First, cook for 10 minutes on high flame,

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,240
then 15 minutes on low flame. That’s it,

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,340
your biryani is ready. See how long

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,979
and separate each grain of rice is?

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,080
This was the actual recipe of Hyderabadi chicken biryani.
