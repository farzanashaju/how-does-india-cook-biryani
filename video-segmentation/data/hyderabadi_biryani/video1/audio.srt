00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:56,798
You’re going to love it a lot. Let’s start making Hyderabadi Biryani. To make Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani, first we need 1 kg of chicken. You can keep the chicken pieces either large or medium in size.

3
00:00:57,304 --> 00:01:24,001
A little more than half a teaspoon of crushed green chilies – you can finely chop or crush them coarsely. Add 2 teaspoons of salt, and juice of one lemon. Add 4 tablespoons full of—

4
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:53,515
Fresh coriander and mint leaves—wash them well and add. 1 tablespoon of garam masala powder. This is Hyderabadi garam masala powder. You’ll find the link in the description box. Just type Hyderabadi G—

5
00:01:54,933 --> 00:02:23,771
Add 1 cup of oil. This is the same oil in which we fried the onions. We are also going to add fried onions now—birista. Now mix everything well. It’s mixed properly. Now we’ll add the fried onions too—

6
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:43,972
Take half a cup of milk, add 2 to 3 pinches of saffron in it. Add this as well. If you don’t have saffron, just add plain milk. Add 1 teaspoon of cardamom powder. If you don’t have powder, crush 4–5 cardamoms and add.

7
00:02:52,342 --> 00:03:17,248
All the ingredients have mixed well with the chicken. Cover it with a lid and let it marinate for 2 hours. You can also marinate it for 3 or 4 hours, or even overnight in the refrigerator.

8
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:43,657
Meanwhile, soak 1 kg of basmati rice for one hour. Our chicken has marinated well and the rice is soaked. Now let’s start preparing to boil the rice. For that, take a large pot—

9
00:03:43,912 --> 00:04:11,349
Add some chopped coriander and mint leaves like this. Now add garam masala powder—a little less than 1 teaspoon. 2 to 3 small cinnamon sticks, 4 to 5 cloves, cardamom, and about a teaspoon of shahi jeera—

10
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:34,334
This gives a nice aroma to the rice. Juice of half a lemon. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. Mix everything well. Once the water starts boiling, we will add the rice.

11
00:04:34,468 --> 00:05:01,942
Let it boil for a minute like this so the spices release their flavor into the water. After adding the rice, mix once or twice gently. Keep the flame on high while the rice is cooking. Now I’ll tell you the timing—

12
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:28,942
Boil the rice for only 3 minutes. After boiling, we’re going to make the first layer of biryani over the chicken. Look, the water now—we’ll take a little of it. The chicken is absorbing the flavors. Three minutes are done.

13
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:43,100
Now let’s make the first layer of biryani. Strain the rice properly and layer it over the chicken.

14
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:30,687
After making the first layer, we’ll boil the rice again for 2 to 3 minutes for the second layer. Two to three minutes are done. Add the second layer. Spread it out evenly. Mix a bit of orange food color in milk—

15
00:06:31,733 --> 00:07:00,437
You can also add yellow food color. Add a little ghee—3 teaspoons. Fresh coriander and mint leaves. Now seal the vessel—with aluminum foil or a cotton cloth. To seal it well, place an old tawa (griddle) below.

16
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:25,564
Cook on high flame for 2–3 minutes. After that, lower the flame and let it cook on "dum" (steam) for 30–40 minutes. Two to three minutes have passed, now we’ll lower the flame. We’ll steam it for 30–40 minutes.

17
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:59,062
Hot chicken biryani is ready!

18
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:21,860
