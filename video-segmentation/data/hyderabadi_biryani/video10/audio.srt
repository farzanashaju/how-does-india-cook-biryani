3
00:00:50,420 --> 00:01:09,876
1.5 tsp salt  
1.5 tsp turmeric powder  
1 tbsp coriander powder  
1 tsp red chili powder  
1 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder

4
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:23,697
We’ll add roasted cumin here. Then we’re going to add some orange food color.

5
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:54,933
Now we’re adding 2 teaspoons of biryani masala. The recipe is already on our channel and the link is in the description, so you can easily make it at home. If you don’t want to make it at home, you can use store-bought.

6
00:01:56,856 --> 00:02:26,032
Mix everything well with the chicken. Now add a handful of finely chopped coriander and a handful of mint leaves. We've taken 4–5 small green chilies.

7
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:55,818
Now we’ve started to roast it. We'll continue adding ingredients as it cooks.

8
00:02:56,391 --> 00:03:22,344
Use onions according to your preference — more or less as you like.

9
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:37,802
You can adjust everything based on your taste and preference.

10
00:03:38,764 --> 00:04:05,713
We will not add water at this stage.

11
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:35,464
Now we're taking rice — for 1 kg of chicken, we’ve taken 1 kg of rice. We soaked it for two hours. We’ve used Golden Sella rice. You can use any rice of your choice.

12
00:04:37,220 --> 00:05:03,021
Make sure to prepare everything carefully.

13
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:26,949
After taking out the whole spices, add 2 tablespoons of mint and 2 tablespoons of coriander, and juice from half a lemon. This makes the rice fluffy and flavorful. Now add the soaked rice.

14
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:52,819
It’s been 15 minutes since the chicken started cooking — it’s nicely tender now. Stir and check that there's no excess water. The masala has turned out great. It’s been 7 minutes since the rice started boiling — check it.

15
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:22,502
Add half of the rice, then add fried onions over it.

16
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:45,942
This adds great flavor. We've added 1 tablespoon kewra water and two pinches of saffron. Add some orange food color, coriander, and mint — about 1–2 handfuls.

17
00:06:48,338 --> 00:07:17,767
If you don’t have foil, you can use a cloth to seal the pot. Cover it with a lid and place a heavy object on top for pressure. Now turn the gas flame to low.

18
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:38,795
The biryani is now on dum (steam cooking) and finishing beautifully.

19
00:07:38,795 --> 00:08:05,237
The biryani has turned out incredibly delicious and aromatic — even better than what you get at weddings. When you make this at home, you’ll see just how amazing this recipe is. Now, let's serve our biryani.
