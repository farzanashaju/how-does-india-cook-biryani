Take half a biryani leaf (bay leaf), 4-5 cardamoms, and a small cinnamon stick and massage everything well into the chicken. Now refrigerate this for one hour. Meanwhile, boil 2 liters of water. To this add 5–6 cloves...

00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:20,194
Soak 1.5 cups of basmati rice in water. (Repeated words in original seem like a speech glitch or stutter, so translated just once.)

00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:53,894
In the rice, add 2 tbsp chopped mint, two pinches of garam masala powder, 3 tbsp ghee, and 3 tbsp fried onions. Add 1 tbsp of the hot water that was soaked with saffron.

00:02:54,028 --> 00:03:17,872
