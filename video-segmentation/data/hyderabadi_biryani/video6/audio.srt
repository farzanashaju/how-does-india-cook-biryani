1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
This Mogalpur chicken has a crisp, sizzling sound.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.620
This is full of love.

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.280
Sometimes, you just feel like making a rich dish at home.

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.960
This is how Mogalpur style is.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:24.740
This is early morning—woke up and made chicken curry. Don’t ask why. People comment a lot, saying to make chicken biryani.

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Everyone loves biryani. It's like they were born for it. Even if it’s not your birthday, biryani feels like a celebration.

7
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:24.720
Everyone celebrates with biryani like it’s a tradition.

8
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:54.720
In the market, you’ll find chickens weighing 3-4 kg, but we should buy around 2 kg for proper biryani.

9
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:24.720
When we ask in restaurants, they give small pieces because they divide the chicken into 3-4 pieces per plate.

10
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:54.720
In our region, we marinate the chicken properly. After a couple of hours, it becomes tender and full of flavor.

11
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:22.900
Add chili powder and mix well. Don’t just sprinkle it on top; coat the chicken properly.

12
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.720
Now, when we eat the pieces, they should taste delicious.

13
00:03:30.720 --> 00:04:00.720
At home, add green chilies, mint, and a bit more spices for extra flavor.

14
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:30.720
Don't add too much garam masala. Just a little cumin and coriander powder is enough.

15
00:04:30.720 --> 00:05:00.700
Use good oil. A little cumin and coriander powder is enough to bring out the taste.

16
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.160
Once it’s cooked well, it smells amazing.

17
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:38.160
We usually see large setups in hotels, but I’m showing you a simple homemade method using curd.

18
00:05:38.160 --> 00:06:08.140
We’ll marinate it simply with curd and basic spices.

19
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Once rice is boiled once, drain the water. It should be semi-cooked before layering.

20
00:06:38.160 --> 00:07:08.140
Add salt accordingly and boil the rice until it’s 70% done.

21
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:38.120
Boil it until it's semi-soft so it finishes cooking with steam.

22
00:07:38.120 --> 00:08:08.120
Once boiled, strain it well. Prepare for layering now.

23
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.120
Chicken should be 70% cooked before layering.

24
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:45.120
Put the chicken at the bottom of the pot. Add a small bowl of rice in layers.

25
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.560
Add all masalas evenly.

26
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.000
The pot should be heavy-bottomed.

27
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.240
Make sure the rice inside is also half-cooked.

28
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.920
Water should be in proper ratio.

29
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.580
Use 4 cups of water for 1 cup of rice.

30
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.960
That’s when it cooks perfectly.

31
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.040
Now, layer everything and close the lid.

32
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.700
Once it's 70% done, lower the flame and seal the pot.

33
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:39.700
Steam it well. That’s how biryani cooks through. Don’t overcook the rice.

34
00:09:39.700 --> 00:10:09.700
Aromatic smell will spread—chicken, mint, onions, all come together beautifully.

35
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:16.320
Layer rice without breaking the grains.

36
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:46.320
Top it with mint, remaining onions, and a bit of ghee for flavor.

37
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.820
Don't add too much oil. Just enough to enhance the taste.

38
00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:23.820
Now place a heavy lid. Some use flour paste to seal it tight. Do what suits you.

39
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:53.820
Steam builds up inside. After 10 minutes, let it come out slowly.

40
00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:23.820
Don't lift the lid too early. Let the steam settle first.

41
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:53.820
Now keep the flame high for 10 minutes for final cooking.

42
00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:23.820
Then reduce heat. Meanwhile, I’ll tell a story—once, I took biryani to school…

43
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:53.820
Everyone was amazed. They asked who made it. My dad said, “My son made this.”

44
00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:23.820
Back then, I’d fill the house with the biryani smell. Now things have changed.

45
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.960
When people argue, they say, "Let’s get divorced."

46
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:57.960
Instead, I say, “Come, let’s eat biryani and talk.”

47
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:05.460
I say this often—but today, my wife isn’t around. I’ll tell her next time.

48
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:35.460
Use a flat heavy lid. Place weight on top to trap steam.

49
00:15:35.460 --> 00:16:05.460
If it looks a bit raw, leave it to dry slightly. Let the water evaporate fully.

50
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:35.460
This is our homemade chicken biryani. Just look at it—perfect texture and aroma.

51
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.540
Don’t just eat it randomly. There's a way to eat biryani too.

52
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:46.960
See this here? That’s mace flower—called javitri.

53
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.120
If you eat it whole, it’s bitter. Remove it before eating.

54
00:16:51.120 --> 00:17:21.120
The fragrance is amazing. We use whole spices like cloves, cardamom, peppercorns.

55
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:51.120
When you serve biryani, mix it slightly before serving. Don’t leave it tight-packed.

56
00:17:51.120 --> 00:18:21.120
My mom doesn’t like this type of biryani. But whenever I eat it, I remember my hometown.

57
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:51.120
Even on Sundays, when we’d go out and have this, I would return home and make it for my family.

58
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.420
Now I live abroad. But I still have permission to make biryani!
