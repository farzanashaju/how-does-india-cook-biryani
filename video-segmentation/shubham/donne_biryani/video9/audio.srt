If you make mutton biryani like this, everyone will enjoy it. It’s easy to prepare.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:22,560
I’ll show you how to make tasty mutton biryani at home. I took ½ kg mutton and ½ kg bullet rice, soaked and washed.

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:33,200
This rice yields about 2.5 bowls. If you don’t have bullet rice, use cumin rice or regular rice.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:43,120
Marinate the mutton with ¾ tsp salt, ½ tsp turmeric, ½ tsp ginger-garlic paste, and ½ cup (100g) yogurt. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes.

5
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,520
Grind mint, coriander, 1-inch sliced ginger, 8–10 garlic cloves, ½ onion, ½ tsp black pepper, ½ tsp anise, and ½ glass water into a fine paste.

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,079
Add green masala to the marinated mutton. Heat a heavy-bottomed pan, add 4–5 tbsp ghee and oil.

7
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:14,640
Add whole garam masala and ½ handful kasoori methi. Fry, then add 3 finely sliced onions and cook till golden brown and crispy.

8
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:55,200
Add marinated mutton. Cook it covered on low heat (or pressure cook for 3–4 whistles). Fry mutton for 2–3 minutes, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

9
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:39,440
Add green masala and fry till raw smell disappears. Cook another 15–20 minutes until water is absorbed. Add ½ glass water and continue cooking until mutton is soft.

10
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:21,120
Add salt to taste and ½ tsp garam masala powder. Mix well and cook another 15–20 minutes on medium flame, stirring every 2 minutes.

11
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Once mutton is fully cooked and water evaporates, add soaked rice and mix gently.

12
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:20,880
Add more green masala. Use bullet, cumin, or normal rice. Add 5 cups of water for 2.5 cups of rice. Squeeze ½ lemon for sourness.

13
00:05:33,520 --> 00:06:01,720
Do not cover. Let rice boil on high heat until 75% cooked. Then reduce to low heat.

14
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:21,840
When rice is almost cooked, cover with a heavy lid (like a pot with water or a stone) and cook on low for 20 minutes.

15
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:41,120
After 20 minutes, open and mix gently. Biryani is cooked perfectly with no sticking.

16
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:54,720
This method is simple and doesn’t require pressure cooking. Thank you for watching.
