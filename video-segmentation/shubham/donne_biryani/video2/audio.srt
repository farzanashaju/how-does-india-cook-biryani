00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,359
Hello everyone, welcome to home cooking

3
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
with Nihima Subramanian

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,640
My all‑time favorite meal is biryani. Now

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
I've tried several varieties of biryani

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
and made many biryani recipes.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
Today I'm adding another special

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,000
biryani to the list: this is done biryani.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
“Done” actually refers to a bowl

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
made from palm leaves, and since this

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,120
biryani is served in a ‘done’, hence the

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,920
name.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
You can make this biryani either

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
with chicken or mutton, but I personally

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
love mutton. I enjoy mutton biryani, so I

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,920
am going to share this wonderful mutton

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,400
biryani recipe. I’ll also give you a couple

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,320
of tips on how to make it with chicken.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
This involves a lot of steps, so make

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
sure you follow them perfectly

21
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,280
to get a beautiful outcome. So why wait? Let’s

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
get started and check out the recipe!

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
For this recipe, I’ve taken

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
two kilos of bone‑in mutton. This is

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
nice, fresh mutton. First we’re

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
going to marinate it. So I’m adding

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,439
two teaspoons of salt,

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,840
about one teaspoon turmeric powder,

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
four teaspoons of red chili powder,

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,840
one tablespoon ginger‑garlic paste,

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
and two tablespoons fresh curd.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
Mix everything well,

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
rubbing the pieces with the marinade.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
This will infuse lots of flavor into the meat.

35
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
You can follow these same

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,159
steps for chicken biryani too.

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,479
Now that it’s marinated, I’m

38
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
letting it rest for about 1 hour.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Meanwhile, I’ll prepare

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
the other masalas for the biryani.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,070
First I’m making the onion‑green‑

42
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,879
chili masala paste. In a pan,

43
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,479
add two teaspoons oil—

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
I’m using gingelly oil, but any vegetable

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
or sunflower oil works. Add a few

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
pieces of cinnamon, some cardamom, cloves,

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
one teaspoon whole peppercorns.

48
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,879
If you have thick cinnamon, two pieces

49
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,280
will do. Then add five large thinly‑sliced

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
onions. Sauté for 2 minutes, then

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
add 10 large green chilies.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Traditional biryanis are hotter,

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
so you can adjust chili quantity

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
based on rice and meat amount.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
Once onions turn translucent,

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
turn off heat and cool the mix.

57
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
When cool, grind it with a little water

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,720
to a fine paste. Set aside.

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,159
Next, for the green masala paste:

60
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,720
in the pan, add one teaspoon oil,

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,560
one bowl fresh mint leaves, one bowl chopped

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,000
coriander leaves, and a handful of fenugreek—

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,680
just enough for flavor. Sauté for 2–3 minutes

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
until wilted, cool completely,

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,759
then grind with a little water to a fine paste.

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
Now to cook the mutton:

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,400
in a pressure cooker, add

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
two teaspoons gingelly oil and

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,280
three tablespoons ghee—for richness. Or reduce ghee

70
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
and use more oil if preferred.

71
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
Add whole spices: one cinnamon, cloves,

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
cardamom pods, three star anise,

73
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
bay leaf, three mace pieces,

74
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
one teaspoon black salt? (stone flour),

75
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
one teaspoon shahi jeera, one teaspoon fennel—

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
keep flame low so spices don’t burn.

77
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
Add one medium thinly‑sliced onion,

78
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
saute until golden brown.

79
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
Then add one teaspoon ginger paste

80
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
and three teaspoons garlic paste—

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,520
this biryani is garlic‑rich.

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
Add one medium chopped tomato (optional),

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
it adds a lovely tanginess.

84
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,759
Now add the marinated mutton pieces.

85
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
For chicken, you could do it all in one pot.

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
But mutton takes longer, so I

87
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
pressure‑cook mutton separately, then cook rice in another.

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
As the meat cooks, it releases lots of juice.

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Stir in onion paste, then green paste,

90
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,800
and mix well with the mutton.

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
Water ratio is very important for this biryani.

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
I measured one kilo of rice (about

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,759
4.75 cups, 250 ml per cup),

94
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,039
and used five-and-a-half cups of water.

95
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,800
Also scrape mixer jars with water to use all masala.

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,160
Add about two teaspoons salt (adjust to taste).

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,879
Pressure‑cook the mutton for ~20 minutes on medium‑low.

98
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,320
Specialty: this biryani uses short‑grain Zeeraga Sambar (Kaima) rice—

99
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
be sure to get that rice.

100
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
Wash rice, soak for 20 minutes.

101
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
The cooked mutton is rich dark green from the paste.

102
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,440
Transfer mutton and gravy to a large pot.

103
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
Add the soaked rice, cook

104
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,399
on medium‑low flame; gently mix rice and gravy.

105
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,720
Taste for salt, adjust for balanced flavor.

106
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,120
Close pot, cook 25 minutes on medium.

107
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,959
After 10 minutes, open the pot and gently mix

108
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,200
so everything blends evenly. After 25 min, rice is cooked

109
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,519
and moisture absorbed. Close and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

110
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,839
Here is the absolutely flavorful and fragrant done biryani.

111
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,800
I’m serving it in a done, with chicken salna, eggs, and raita on the side.

112
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
This is a delightful biryani—I really enjoyed

113
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
sharing it with you. Hope you try

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
it and enjoy.

So there you go—here is this incredible done biryani.

119
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,040
The flavors are just fantastic. Follow all

120
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,279
the steps to get it right. You can make it

121
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,279
with chicken or mutton. It’s best served

122
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320
with raita, and you can also enjoy it

123
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
with salad or gravy. Do try the recipe,

124
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
enjoy and share with your family and friends.
