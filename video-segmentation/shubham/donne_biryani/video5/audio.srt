Have you heard of the Bangalore Special Donne Biryani? It has a very unique taste. Let’s see how to prepare it step-by-step.

00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:53,152
Greetings to everyone, I’m Hema Subramanyam. Welcome to Home Cooking Telugu. I’ve shown many varieties of biryani before. Today, I’ll show you Karnataka’s special mutton biryani. This is very popular in Bangalore.

3
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:24,371
Take 2 kg of mutton...

4
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:43,998
...and chop it into medium-sized pieces.

5
00:01:47,626 --> 00:02:10,643
First, to prepare the onion masala paste, I’m adding 2 tsp of sesame oil in a pan. You can also use regular oil if you prefer. To that, add a few pieces of cinnamon stick, four...

6
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:26,810
...cloves (2 pieces), and continue sautéing.

7
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:49,657
If the biryani is spicy, it tastes really good, so don’t hesitate to use good quality spices.

8
00:02:54,991 --> 00:03:24,538
Sauté them slightly in a little water and grind to a fine paste. I’m adding the onion masala paste into a bowl and setting it aside. It gives a great aroma. When used in biryani, it adds nice fragrance to the rice too.

9
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:38,122
Take 1 handful of fresh mint leaves.

10
00:03:39,152 --> 00:04:05,207
Adding fenugreek leaves gives a lovely flavor to biryani. A handful is enough—too much might make it bitter. Wash and clean them properly.

11
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:16,548
The green masala paste is now ready. I’ve kept it aside in a bowl.

12
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:57,435
Now, for cooking the mutton, add 2 tsp of sesame oil in a pressure cooker. Add 3 tablespoons of ghee as well—this enhances the flavor. Don’t add too much, just a little is enough.

13
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:23,947
Add 1 tsp of shajeera (caraway seeds), 1 tsp of fennel seeds, 1 tsp of chopped onion, 1 tsp of ginger paste, and 3 tsp of garlic paste.

14
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:42,154
Since the proportion of ginger and garlic is different in this recipe, I’m using separate pastes. After mixing everything once, add one medium-sized tomato chopped finely.

15
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:57,173
The tangy flavor adds a nice touch to the biryani. That’s why I’m showing you this Bangalore-style method. Now add the marinated mutton pieces directly into this mixture.

16
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:16,899
Add 6 types of spices...

17
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:48,000
You’ll see the juices start coming out of the mutton. At this point, add the previously prepared onion masala paste. Mix it thoroughly so it coats the mutton well.

18
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:18,798
Add 1 kg of biryani rice...

19
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,286
Add 2 tsp of ground spices...

20
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:57,238
Mix everything well and place it in the pressure cooker. Cook on medium flame for at least 20 minutes. For this biryani, use only jeeraga samba rice for authenticity. This rice variety is commonly used in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

21
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:03,617
Wash the rice thoroughly with water and soak it for at least 20 minutes.

22
00:08:46,649 --> 00:09:12,772
Cook it on a medium flame for the best results. After everything is mixed well, adjust salt as needed.

23
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:45,778
After 25 minutes, the moisture will be gone and you’ll see perfectly cooked biryani. After turning off the heat, let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to settle.

24
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:38,563
So, that’s how you make mutton donne biryani. I used 1 kg of jeeraga samba rice. This special biryani is traditionally made with this rice. You can also make it with chicken. I’ve explained the full process clearly in the video. Just follow the steps and you’ll get it right. Definitely try this tasty donne biryani at home and enjoy!
