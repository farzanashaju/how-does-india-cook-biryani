00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:34,945
Original Biryani - Picchekista Bobby Style

3
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:49,947
Happy, happy — did you eat? Let’s make it spicy again!

00:00:49,947 --> 00:01:08,222
This is Dunne Biryani from Shivaji Military Hotel, Bangalore – very famous! They make it with mutton and chicken. Nearby, they cook chicken separately. When you see it, your mouth starts watering. The combination is just extraordinary!

5
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:38,058
The taste is amazing! They use a 50-50 mix of oil and ghee with Chitti Mutyala rice. That’s why it’s super special. And the combination of spices used is mind-blowing. Truly makes you go crazy with delight!

6
00:01:38,058 --> 00:02:04,501
Every part of my tongue is activated! So much flavor, it’s overwhelming!

7
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:20,497
You can't eat this daily. It’s rare and rich. But when you do get a chance, don’t miss trying it! Bobby bro... wow! What a biryani this is! How did I miss this all these days?

8
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:45,354
Watch the recipe till the end, no skipping!

9
00:02:45,354 --> 00:03:02,787
Let’s start making Dunne Biryani. It serves a big group. For 1.5 kg of chicken, add enough salt. Add about 200 grams of yogurt.

00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:36,031

00:03:36,959 --> 00:04:01,175
Once you've seen the video, measure out the ingredients accordingly. If something is not available at home, ask a neighbor or order from BigBasket!

12
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:09,055
Add 2 bunches of coriander (about 2 full cups). Also, 20 dark green chilies – absolutely necessary.

13
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:37,978
Another important ingredient is ghee, ghee, ghee, ghee... [repeatedly said for emphasis]

14
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:20,403
This water infused with rose petals is very beneficial. Let me show my love that way. Rose... rose...

15
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,925
Finely chop onions and tomatoes like this.

16
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:57,949
Now we prepare the masala powder: 1.5-inch cinnamon, 1 mace flower, 1.5 Marathi moggu, 4 cardamoms, 4 cloves, 2 tablespoons fennel, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 bay leaf — all blended.

17
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:21,187
Once it’s fresh, add all of it and lightly fry on medium flame for 1 minute, then 3 more minutes on low flame.

18
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:51,781
Remove and cool it on a plate, and apply oil thoroughly. Now, to make the biryani, take a large vessel, add 2 cups of oil (around 8 tablespoons).

19
00:06:51,781 --> 00:07:13,617
Add 3 bay leaves and fry them for 2 minutes. Add the chopped onions and sauté for 3 minutes on medium flam
