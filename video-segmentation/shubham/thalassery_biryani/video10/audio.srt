Hi! Hello! Welcome to our channel! We're so glad you're here.

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,045
Thank you!

00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:38,597
Take 2 medium-sized onions and slice them thinly. Add 1 tsp of sugar.

4
00:01:49,280 --> 00:02:14,913
We've finished frying the onions. Now transfer them to a bowl. Let's prepare the biryani masala using the same ghee we used to fry the onions.

5
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:32,867
For the masala, take 4 medium-sized onions and slice them lengthwise. Add enough salt and mix it well.

6
00:02:41,693 --> 00:03:10,955
[Background sounds removed due to corruption.]

00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:41,194
[Audio appears to be corrupted or unclear, skipped for continuity.]

8
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:21,322
Add 2 tsp garam masala. Now add 1 kg of chicken and mix well.

9
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:41,927
Add 1 tbsp lemon juice and 3 tbsp curd.

10
00:04:47,394 --> 00:05:11,172
[Audio unintelligible, skipped.]

11
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:43,083
[Audio unintelligible, skipped.]

12
00:05:44,281 --> 00:06:00,564
Add 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste.

13
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:26,232
[Repeated "1" — likely an error or placeholder. Skipped.]

[Audio unintelligible, skipped.]

15
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:25,041
...and...

16
00:07:56,293 --> 00:08:08,764
Now the biryani is set and placed on dum. Let it cook for 10 minutes on the lowest flame. We’ve sealed the lid to retain the steam.

17
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:28,052
