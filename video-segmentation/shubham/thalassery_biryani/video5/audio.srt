Today we're going to see how to make Thalassery Chicken Biryani. First, we'll prepare the Bista, which means fried onions. I’ve taken one large onion, sliced thin. Also, 1 tbsp raisins and 8 cashew nuts. You can use more if desired.

2
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:54,030
1 tsp pepper powder, 2 tsp fennel seeds, 1 tsp cumin, 8 cardamoms, 2 dried red chillies, 2 pieces of cinnamon, 10 cloves of garlic.

3
00:00:54,301 --> 00:01:23,966
1 tbsp tomato, 1 tsp black cumin (shah jeera), 3 red chilies, 2 inches cinnamon. Roast and grind all together. Use Jeerakasala or Khaima rice. If unavailable, basmati is fine.

5
00:01:52,908 --> 00:02:12,247
3.25 kg chicken, 2 medium onions, 2 medium tomatoes, 8 green chilies.

6
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:37,610
3 tbsp ginger garlic paste, 1 tbsp lemon juice, ½ tbsp milk, ½ tbsp water.

7
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:52,712
1¼ tsp turmeric, a handful of mint, a handful of coriander. Dry roast the masala.

8
00:02:52,712 --> 00:03:15,292
Add asafoetida. Roast for 2 minutes on low flame.

9
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:38,848
Turn off the flame and stir for a bit. Let cool and grind. Masala is ready. Now fry the onions in oil.

10
00:03:42,223 --> 00:04:11,062
Fry them well in sunflower oil. Ghee can be used for more flavor. I’m double frying. Double frying needs more oil. Once crisp, transfer to a plate. Now fry cashews and raisins.

11
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:36,882
Don’t over-fry raisins – just until they puff. Set aside. Crush half the onions (bista) to add to the chicken masala. The rest will be used for garnish.

12
00:04:37,000 --> 00:05:06,278
Add 1.5 tbsp dalda and 1 tbsp ghee.

00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:33,598

[Unclear language or visuals only – assumed continued prep]

15
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:30,552
Now the chicken is soft and well-cooked. Add 1 tbsp lemon juice. Mix and continue to cook uncovered to reduce the gravy.

16
00:06:31,766 --> 00:07:01,112
Add crushed fried onions and mix. Check for salt and adjust if needed.

19
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:27,360
Mix well and close the lid. Cook rice till 75% done. Now add chicken masala to the biryani dum layer. Don’t add too much.

00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:51,981

[No meaningful speech – unclear section]

22
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:34,692
Add remaining rice. Garnish with onions, cashew nuts, and raisins. Sprinkle 2 pinches of masala powder.

23
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:56,849
Add 1½ tbsp ghee and 1½ tsp rose water. Place biryani over a heated dosa tawa. Cover tightly with foil and a lid to seal the steam.

24
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:27,427
[Repetitive phrase – likely filler or chant while dum cooking]

25
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:54,476
Now mix everything well. Lift chicken from bottom, spread masala, and then top with rice.
