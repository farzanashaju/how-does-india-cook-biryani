Today, I'm going to share a very special biryani all the way from Kerala. This is from the Malabar region—Talasheri Chicken Biryani. It's made using small-grain Jeeraga Sala or Jeeraga Samba rice, also known as Kaima rice. There are a couple of steps involved, so let's get started and dive right into the recipe.",
