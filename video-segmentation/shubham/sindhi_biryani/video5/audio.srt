As-salamu alaykum. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A special recipe for a special occasion. Eid is near, so let’s make a delicious original degi Sindhi Biryani, as requested.

2
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:41,576
Avoid packaged spice mixes for this Eid. We’ll make a tasty degi Sindhi Biryani with fresh spices, just like in big pots, with great aroma and flavor, using an easy method. Let’s start the recipe.

3
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:59,060
I’m using Falak brand rice, but you can also use sela rice. Wash the rice well and soak in clean water for about 15 minutes.

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:26,447
Since it’s Sindhi Biryani, I’ll boil the potatoes. I’ve taken 5 medium-sized potatoes, peeled, cleaned, and cut one into two pieces as per degi style.

5
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:54,240
Now moving on, either take a pressure cooker for quicker biryani or an open pot like I use. Add one cup of oil or melted ghee. Slice five medium onions.

6
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:09,242
We’ll use these fried onions while layering biryani. Add a little water to stop browning, spread on a tissue to dry, and keep aside.

7
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:31,534
Now for the meat: I’m using 1.25 kg of goat meat with bone for richer flavor. Add ginger garlic paste.

8
00:02:31,534 --> 00:03:00,644
Add 5–6 green cardamoms, 1 tbsp whole white cumin, 3 black cardamoms, 2 star anise, and small cinnamon sticks.

9
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:24,269
Add 1 tbsp crushed red chili, ½ tsp turmeric, and 1 tbsp salt (adjust to taste), and ½ tbsp ground spices.

10
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:48,889
Chicken powder is essential; I use Dashi brand. Add 3 medium chopped tomatoes. Skip chicken powder if desired.

11
00:03:48,889 --> 00:04:07,907
Add ½ cup yogurt and 7–8 dried plums. Add 4 chopped green chilies or 1 tbsp paste.

12
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:24,547
Fry this mixture well to enhance the aroma and taste. Frying removes any meat smell.

13
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:45,639
Add 3½ glasses of water for the meat to tenderize. Add ¼ tsp yellow food color for authentic degi biryani look.

14
00:04:45,639 --> 00:05:12,033
Cover the pot and simmer on low heat for 1 to 1¼ hours until meat is soft. Prepare the fresh herb mix for layering.

15
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:27,035
Add ½ tsp homemade saffron garam masala, ¼ tsp mace powder, ¼ tsp nutmeg powder, and ½ tsp chaat masala.

16
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:43,201
Add chopped coriander and mint. Save some for the final layering. Mix well; herb mix is ready.

17
00:05:43,201 --> 00:06:06,201
Set aside the herb mix. The meat has cooked well over 1.5 hours. It’s perfectly tender now.

18
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:22,300
Mix the curry and potatoes so they absorb flavor. Now add the prepared herb mix.

19
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:49,721
Move the masala to the side of the pot to avoid burning. Keep meat, potatoes, and masala to the side.

20
00:06:49,721 --> 00:07:07,541
Add 1.5 tbsp oil on top of the curry. The korma is ready. Now let’s boil the rice.

21
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:30,560
In boiling water, add 1 tbsp cumin, 1 black cardamom, 6–7 cloves, 2 bay leaves, 1 small cinnamon stick, and 10–12 black pepper.

22
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:48,514
Boil the rice on high heat until slightly undercooked—only 3–5 minutes. Start the timer when water boils.

23
00:07:48,514 --> 00:08:08,831
Check if rice is long and soft with a slight bite. That’s the sign to stop.

24
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:38,059
Now layer all the rice on top of the curry. Add dark yellow food color for tri-color look. Add fried onions.

25
00:08:38,059 --> 00:09:05,751
Let it steam for 15 minutes. The aroma is amazing. Karachi-style degi Sindhi biryani is ready!

26
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:27,942
I used to serve biryani in this platter. Today I felt like using it again. It looks amazing!

27
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:37,240
If you’ve never succeeded before, try this recipe. You won’t even touch packet spices again.
