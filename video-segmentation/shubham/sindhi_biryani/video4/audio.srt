2
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:33,005
First, I’ve taken 700 grams of chicken and I’ll add some spices to it. I added one tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and some spices along with salt according to the chicken quantity.

3
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:59,042
I’ve added 2 to 3 green chilies—adjust as per your spice level. I added chopped coriander, mint, one chopped tomato, and two medium-sized onions fried into birista (crispy onions).

4
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:23,174
This is biryani masala. I used Suhana biryani masala here, but you can use any brand you have available. I added two heaping tablespoons. These are dried plums (Aloo Bukhara), which are essential for Sindhi Biryani.

5
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:32,572
I’ve taken a pinch of saffron and soaked it in warm water. This gives a nice color and enhances the flavor during the layering of the biryani.

6
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:59,927
Take a little water, and I’ve added two medium-sized potatoes and some food coloring to it. I also added a few drops of kewra essence. If you don’t have it, you can skip it, but it adds a nice fragrance.

7
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:29,272
Now I’m adding the potatoes we soaked. They’ve taken on the color and flavor. Keep the flame high so that it comes to a strong boil. I’ll now mix it well on high heat.

8
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:58,282
Once it starts boiling, reduce the flame to medium. Cover and cook it for 15–20 minutes until the chicken becomes tender. Meanwhile, we’ll prep the rice.

9
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:29,111
The rice comes out fluffy and separate. Add 2 bay leaves, 2–3 cloves, 2–3 black peppercorns, 2–3 green cardamoms, and 2 cinnamon sticks. Boil the water well before adding rice.

10
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:55,960
Check the rice—they should be firm but cooked, not mushy or too soft. The chicken is ready now. I checked it once midway to ensure the water hadn’t dried up.

11
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:07,925
Now layer one-fourth of the rice at the bottom. Then garnish it with thin lemon slices.

12
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:32,629
Next, arrange tomato slices. Traditionally, thick green chilies are used which are not spicy, but I didn’t have them, so I used chopped regular ones. Add some coriander, mint, and the saffron we soaked earlier.

13
00:04:35,312 --> 00:05:01,334
Spread the chicken evenly. Add the remaining rice on top. I used half a kilo of rice for this recipe. Again, place sliced tomatoes and lemons along with some fresh coriander.

14
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:27,793
The leftover oil from the chicken korma—add a bit of it here to keep the rice moist and prevent it from drying out. Cover and cook on low heat.

15
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:49,985
Sindhi Biryani is ready! It’s a slightly different recipe but tastes absolutely delicious. Definitely give it a try. And as always, if you liked the recipe, don’t forget to like, share, and subscribe. That’s all for today—see you next time!
