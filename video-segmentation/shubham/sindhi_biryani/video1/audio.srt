As-salamu alaykum. Today I'm sharing with you the recipe to make Sindhi Biryani. It's quite different from regular biryani — much spicier and more flavorful by comparison.

2
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:40,479
To make Sindhi Biryani, we first need to prepare the biryani masala powder. Take 1 tbsp coriander seeds, 1 tsp white cumin, ½ tsp black cumin (shahi jeera), and 1 tsp...

3
00:00:40,884 --> 00:01:03,497
...¼ piece of nutmeg, 1 black cardamom, 2 small cinnamon sticks, 12–13 green cardamoms, 1 star anise, and 5–6...

4
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:30,007
I’ve ground all the whole spices into a powder. Now add 1 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder (you can use regular chili but it'll be spicier), 2 tsp or to taste...

5
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:50,257
Sindhi biryani uses dried plums (aloo bukhara), so try to add them. If you don’t have them, you can substitute with a bay leaf. Mix everything well, and your masala is ready.

6
00:01:52,772 --> 00:02:09,412
For the biryani, I’ve taken 1 kg chicken. I’ll be using equal parts rice and chicken — so 1 kg rice as well. Now add 3 tablespoons...

7
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:37,019
Add ginger-garlic paste and the masala we just made. This is a great homemade spice blend — no need for store-bought masala.

8
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:52,949
Add green chilies to taste — I’m adding 2–3. Also add chopped coriander, mint, and 2 medium-sized tomatoes (about ½ cup).

9
00:02:53,793 --> 00:03:10,145
Mix all ingredients well. If you have time, marinate for longer. If not, just 20–25 minutes is enough — don’t over-marinate.

10
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:41,633
For layering, I’ve sliced 3 medium tomatoes. Altogether, I’ve used 300g tomatoes in this recipe.

11
00:03:43,270 --> 00:04:05,814
I’ve also taken 3 medium-sized potatoes, cut into large chunks, and soaked them in orange food color for 30 mins. This is optional.

12
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:15,907
I’ve soaked the rice for 1 hour. Use any good quality basmati rice that you usually prefer for biryani.

13
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:40,459
Let’s start making the biryani. Take a pan and add ½ cup oil. Total we’ll use 1 cup oil (approx. 250ml). We’ll use the other half later during layering.

14
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:56,305
We’ll use one onion later for layering. Now add the marinated chicken to the pan. No need to add any extra spices — everything is already in it. Cook on high flame.

15
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:25,245
We want to cook the chicken, so now add the potatoes as well, and ½ cup water. Mix well and cover to cook for about 20 minutes.

16
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:56,211
I cooked the chicken for 20–25 minutes on low flame. It's fully done. Now turn the flame to high and dry up any extra water completely.

17
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:23,464
Take 4 times the rice quantity of water. Add 3 tbsp salt and 2 tbsp oil. This keeps the rice from sticking. Also add lemon slices for flavor.

18
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:54,666
Once the water boils, add the soaked rice. Since it’s soaked well, it will cook quickly. Cook on high flame till the rice is about 70% done.

19
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:26,240
Now prepare for layering. First apply oil at the bottom of the pot. This prevents sticking or burning. Add one layer of rice, then...

20
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:50,218
...add the next layer of chicken masala and some rice. Save a bit of rice for the top layer. Now sprinkle coriander and mint.

21
00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:09,862
Pour the remaining gravy on top. Add the last layer of rice, followed by tomato, mint, coriander, ginger, green chilies, and fried onions.

22
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:31,951
Now pour the remaining oil on top — this is the same oil we used to fry the onions. I’ve used 1 cup total oil. Don’t worry if it feels like too much — biryani needs it.

23
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:49,163
Now seal the pot — I’m using foil. You can also use a towel. Cook on high for 2 minutes, then place a heavy griddle (tawa) or plate below for dum.

24
00:08:50,394 --> 00:09:09,682
Once there’s good steam, that means your biryani is cooked through. Now gently mix from bottom to top.

25
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:21,832
Mix gently so that the rice doesn't break and the masala gets distributed evenly. The biryani is now ready to serve.

26
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:52,461
So this is how our Sindhi Biryani is made. I wish you could smell how aromatic it is! It’s super tasty and very easy to make — not complicated at all.

00:09:54,216 --> 00:10:02,467
