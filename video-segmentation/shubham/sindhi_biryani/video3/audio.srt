Welcome, welcome, welcome.

Assalamualaikum. Whenever I share a recipe with Shan mixes, you all really love it. So today, I’ve brought a different recipe from Shan’s biryani range. I’m going to make Shan Sindhi Biryani.

Before starting the video, I have a small request. If you haven’t subscribed to my channel yet, please do so and also click the notification bell so you never miss a video.

00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:13,623
Let’s start the recipe. I’ve taken three medium-sized potatoes, peeled and sliced them in the middle. I added about 1.25 tsp of orange food color and mixed well.

5
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:39,069
I will fry them for about 10 to 12 minutes. This softens them about 50-60%, and when we steam the biryani, they’ll be fully cooked.

6
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:54,915
I’ve kept the fried potatoes aside. Now we’ll start making the korma. I added about half a cup of oil to a pan and four medium-sized onions, finely sliced.

7
00:01:54,915 --> 00:02:17,680
Now I’ll add some whole spices: a 1-inch cinnamon stick, 4–5 cloves, 1 black cardamom pod, and about 1 tsp cumin seeds. These are enough.

8
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:40,849
Cook the spices for about a minute. Then I added around 750g of chicken (with bones, but you can use boneless too). I’ll now cook the chicken thoroughly.

9
00:02:53,675 --> 00:03:18,075
Here’s a tip I often share: I cook the chicken covered in intervals. I cover it for a while, then fry it, then cover again. This cooks it well without burning.

10
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:38,663
Now I’ve added a full packet of Shan Sindhi Biryani masala and 3–4 tbsp of water so that the masala doesn’t burn. This also helps soften the tomatoes.

11
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:51,556
I’ve covered it again. As you can see, the tomatoes have softened and dissolved well, and the gravy is ready. I sautéed it for just 4–5 minutes more.

12
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:32,309
Now I’m adding about 1 cup of fresh yogurt. Beat the yogurt well and add it to the gravy. Cook for another 4–5 minutes. Then cover and remove it from heat.

13
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:41,641
Set this aside. Now we’ll start boiling the rice.

14
00:04:42,112 --> 00:05:10,817
I took 750g of long grain basmati rice, washed and soaked them for 30 minutes. Now take a large pot and add plenty of water (around 4–5 liters).

15
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:40,416
Add salt: 1 heaped tbsp per 1 cup of rice. If not heaped, then about 4 tbsp for 3 cups. Then boil the rice.

16
00:05:40,416 --> 00:06:04,480
The fried potatoes will now go in. Take 1 medium tomato, thinly sliced. Also, 4–5 green chilies, a handful of mint leaves, and 1 lemon.

17
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:32,036
I took a little extra color because we’ll use some in the layers and dissolve the rest in water. Now we’ll start layering. First, a layer of rice.

18
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:53,536
After that, all the toppings go in. Again a layer of rice, then chicken, and now I’m adding some dry food color. I’ll dissolve some more in water and pour that too.

19
00:06:53,536 --> 00:07:14,072
That way we get both light yellow and orange-tinted rice, which looks beautiful. This technique gives a nice effect. Now I’ll add more food color on top.

20
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:41,139
First, cook on medium flame for 5 minutes, then reduce to very low flame. If your pot is heavy-bottomed, no need for a tawa below. If it’s not, place one.

21
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:59,197
I’ve served this with raita and salad. This Shan Sindhi Biryani turns out delicious—definitely try it and let me know in the comments. I’ll wait for your feedback. I will see you in the next video.
