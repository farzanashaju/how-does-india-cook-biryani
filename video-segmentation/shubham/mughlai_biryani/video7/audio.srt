I’ve added 150 gm of oil, heated it, and now added 3 tbsp of ginger garlic paste. Sauté this for 2–3 minutes to remove the raw smell. We're preparing the biryani masala — it turns out very delicious and is super quick to make.

3
00:00:56,747 --> 00:01:26,161
Add slit green chilies, curry leaves, and finely chopped onions. For whole spices, add 1 cinnamon stick, 1 black cardamom, 5–6 cloves, and 4–5 black peppercorns. Add 2 tsp coriander powder.

4
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:50,950
Add 1 tsp red chili powder and whole cumin seeds. Sauté everything well. Cook it until the tomatoes soften completely and form a fine paste. As you can see, we’ve just added the tomatoes, so…

5
00:01:52,587 --> 00:02:12,955
Cook until tomatoes are nicely mashed. Stir in between so the masala doesn’t stick to the bottom. Then cover and cook for another 2–3 minutes until the oil rises to the surface.

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:41,051
Now cook it for 1–2 more minutes covered. As you can see, the tomatoes are soft and the oil has come up — that means the masala is ready. Now I’ll turn off the flame and start boiling the rice.

7
00:02:41,676 --> 00:03:06,431
I’ve taken about 1 kg of basmati rice because biryani tastes best with basmati. We’ll boil it in water with salt and whole spices. You can add a bay leaf too. I’ve added a black cardamom here...

8
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:37,498
In the pot where we’ll cook the biryani, add 1 kg chicken and the prepared masala. This is a superb recipe and trust me, it comes together really fast with minimal effort.

9
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:44,418
You can make it fresh at home or use readymade masala. Add 1 tsp garam masala powder.

10
00:03:46,223 --> 00:04:15,534
Mix everything well. After mixing, marinate it for 30 minutes. If you're short on time, you can cook it right away. But marinating makes the chicken more flavorful.

11
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:45,843
Now our rice is almost done. Check it — it shouldn't be 100% cooked, just about 75%, because the remaining 25% will cook during the dum process. So keep it slightly undercooked. We’ll drain it in 2 minutes.

12
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:56,591
After 2 minutes, strain the rice. Now we’ll layer the boiled rice over the chicken and masala.

13
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:25,685
I usually do it this way — keep all the masala at the bottom and layer the rice on top. If you like, you can do it in layers — a layer of masala, then rice, and so on. I prefer doing it my way...

14
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:44,821
The aroma and flavor of desi ghee is amazing in biryani. I haven’t used any food color here. Instead, I soaked saffron in water and added that. It gives a lovely color and taste...

15
00:05:44,821 --> 00:06:11,129
For garnishing, use fried onions, cashews, coriander, mint — whatever you prefer. I’ll put it on dum for 45 minutes.

16
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:40,711
Now let’s check if the biryani is done. Make some space in the middle and see if there’s water on the sides. If only oil is visible, it means the biryani has cooked perfectly on dum.

17
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:56,168
