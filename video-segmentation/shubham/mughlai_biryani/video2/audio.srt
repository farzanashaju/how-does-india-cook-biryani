Assalamualaikum, friends. Biryani is made in many ways, and each city and state has its own style. Today we’re making a very simple Mughlai Chicken Biryani, easily made at home.

2
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:45,020
Let’s begin the recipe. First, marinate around 750g of chicken. Add 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, 1 cup curd, and half a tsp of...

3
00:00:46,100 --> 00:01:10,736
...lemon juice. Mix everything well and set aside for 30 minutes. In a wok, heat some oil, add 3 green cardamoms, 3 cloves, and 1 black cardamom.

4
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:40,319
Once the onions are golden brown, add the marinated chicken. Cook on high flame for 4–5 minutes, then cover and cook for 20–25 minutes until the chicken is tender.

5
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:59,269
Add nutmeg and mace powder, mix everything, and cook for 1–2 minutes. The chicken masala is now ready. See how simple it was?

6
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:23,603
The masala has the right amount of gravy—not too dry, around 1 cup of liquid. Now we turn off the flame and move on to the next step.

7
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:54,467
We’re using 400g of basmati rice, boiled with bay leaf, cumin seeds, lemon juice, and a bit of oil. Cooked about 95%. You can see the grains are separate.

8
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:20,539
Add a little mint, then layer the rest of the rice. Pour about 1/4 cup milk, 1 tbsp melted ghee, and the same nutmeg-mace powder on top.

9
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:48,467
Add about 1 tsp kewra water and some fried onions. Cover tightly with silver foil and steam on high for 1 minute, then on low for 12–15 minutes.

00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,415
Enjoy your delicious biryani!
