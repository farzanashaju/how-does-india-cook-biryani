If you enjoy this recipe, don’t forget to like and share it. Let’s get started. First, wash basmati rice thoroughly and soak it for 30 minutes. Next, we’ll marinate the chicken.

3
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:57,625
Add 3 tbsp chopped coriander, 2 tbsp mint, 1/4 cup fried onions, and 3 tbsp of the same oil used to fry the onions. Mix it all well.

4
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:14,769
Cover and let it marinate for 30 minutes. After that, we’ll prepare a paste. In a mixer, blend 1/2 cup fried onions and 1/4 cup curd (yogurt). No need to add water.

5
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:39,457
Once blended, set aside. Now, we’ve set 7 cups of water to boil for the rice. Add salt to taste and whole spices like 1 tsp caraway seeds...

6
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:59,557
As soon as we add rice, water temperature will drop, so bring it back to boil. Let the rice cook for 2 minutes. It should be soft but not fully cooked.

7
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:29,780
Drain the rice once done. Now let’s quickly make the biryani gravy. Heat 2 tbsp oil, add cinnamon, star anise, 3 green cardamoms, and...

8
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:56,240
The chicken is now turning from pink to white. Add 1/4 cup water and mix. Cover and cook for 15 minutes on medium heat. Stir occasionally.

9
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:28,301
Add the spices: 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp red chili powder, 2 tsp coriander powder, and 1/2 tsp cumin powder. Fry this for 2–3 minutes.

10
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:56,467
Mix well. Cover and cook until the gravy comes to a boil. Once it does, give it a stir and add 2 green chilies. Cover and cook for another 10 minutes.

11
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:23,939
By now, the chicken should be completely cooked. Stir occasionally so the spices don’t burn. After 10 minutes, the oil has separated and the gravy looks perfect.

12
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:56,761
Mix it once. As soon as you add cream, the gravy’s color will change to a lighter shade. Add coriander and fried onions. Mix again.

13
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:31,237
The Mughlai chicken gravy is ready and tastes amazing. Taste it and adjust salt if needed. Now we’ll layer cooked rice on top of this.

14
00:05:36,045 --> 00:06:04,345
Add orange food color if available; if not, that’s okay. Add 1 tsp biryani masala. Soak saffron in 1/4 cup warm milk for 10 mins and pour that in too.

15
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:35,024
I’ve already fried cashews and almonds in ghee, so I’m adding them now. Since it’s Mughlai biryani, dry fruits are a must. Add more if you like.

16
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:50,026
Now cover the pot. If you have a tight-fitting lid, use it. I’m using a plate to cover. Place the biryani pot on a tawa (griddle) to prevent burning.

17
00:06:52,675 --> 00:07:22,661
Place some weight on top and let it cook on dum. This helps retain steam and evenly cook rice and chicken. Cook on medium heat for 5 minutes...

18
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:31,892
After 10 minutes, open the lid. Wow! The aroma is amazing!

19
00:07:39,470 --> 00:08:03,178
See how perfectly the rice is cooked? Nothing stuck at the bottom. If there’s some gravy left at the bottom, cook uncovered on low heat till dry.
