Hello Pichakista Crazy Food Lovers, Namaskaram, Vanakkam, Namaskara. This time, for Pichakista Bobby, another crazy peak-level recipe – he made Ambur Biryani. I can’t describe how amazing the taste is in just words. Just by looking at it, it makes you drool, like…

2
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:39,012
When we go to Tamil Nadu, this Ambur Biryani is very famous. The moment you see it, you’ll understand. The color, the layers – everything looks spot on. What a flavor!

3
00:00:39,012 --> 00:01:07,361
Seriously, it’s so mild, but when you eat it, the aroma… aroma… aroma… (repeats many times) fills your mouth and mind completely.

5
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:47,474
Let’s take 1 kg Jeera rice, 1 kg Chittimuthyalu rice, and 1 kg chicken. Let’s take the rice and chicken in two bowls.

6
00:01:47,474 --> 00:02:04,012
100 grams garlic (₹40), 10 dry red chillies, 3 medium-sized tomatoes, 10 cardamoms, 10 cloves, 2 inches cinnamon, 2 green chillies.

7
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:21,004
We will make ginger paste, and garlic paste, green chilli paste, and onion paste.

8
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:48,781
Take a heavy-bottomed vessel for making biryani. Add nearly 100 ml of oil. (repetitive sounds follow)

9
00:02:53,084 --> 00:03:21,586
Now I’m adding onions. After mixing the onions, keep them on medium flame for around 5 minutes and fry till they become golden brown.

10
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:34,039
Add ginger paste. Cook it slowly… slowly… (repeats slowly)

11
00:03:37,194 --> 00:04:04,972
Add green chilli paste. (repeated)

12
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:22,605
1 tbsp garam masala… (repeated multiple times in Telugu: మాపిస్త్లు)

13
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:35,767
Tomatoes… (stretched out pronunciation)

14
00:04:39,024 --> 00:05:00,017
Let it cook for 1 minute… (repeated: మిట్స్ = minutes)

15
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:33,987
After hearing the sizzling sound, mix everything, and cook for 5 minutes on low to medium flame, shifting between both. Every piece will get perfectly fried. Tomatoes…

16
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:58,675
3.5 glasses of hot water for 4 glasses of rice.

17
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:21,237
3 liters water, 6 tablespoons salt, for 30 minutes.

18
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:39,985
Rice… we will cook it 70% for dum biryani. Yes. Yes. Rice.

19
00:06:39,985 --> 00:07:05,163
Now the chicken… (unclear murmuring and repetitive babbling while cooking)

20
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:22,358
6–7 minutes… (repeated babble)

21
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:40,194
5 minutes… (repeated babble)

22
00:07:40,194 --> 00:08:04,461
After turning off the stove, you must rest it for only 15 minutes. What else? This is it! If you serve this Ambur Biryani with love, it’s truly amazing! The rice is perfectly cooked, each grain full of juicy, juicy flavor!

23
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:23,293
We also made prawns in Bheemavaram style, and prawn pakora in Kakinada style. I’ll share those recipe videos in about a week. Stay tuned! Alright? Okay!

24
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:51,879
No problem, no, no, no… (babble/cheer)

25
00:08:52,825 --> 00:09:11,523
