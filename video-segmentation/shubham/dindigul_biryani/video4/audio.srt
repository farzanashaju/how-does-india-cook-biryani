00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Today, we are going to make a famous biryani from Tamil Nadu using a pressure cooker.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:35.400
This biryani is a specialty at many famous restaurants in Tamil Nadu and is known for its unique flavor.

3
00:00:35.400 --> 00:01:05.400
First, we add 1 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp Kashmiri chili powder, and a bit of salt to yogurt and mix well.

4
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.460
Then add ginger-garlic paste and marinate the chicken. Let it rest for a while.

5
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.460
Now mix everything together thoroughly with the chicken.

6
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:45.460
We’re going to make a special masala now. For that, we’ll use mint leaves, coriander leaves, onions, and green chilies.

7
00:01:45.460 --> 00:02:15.460
Grind the mixture well. Now we’ll cook this in a pressure cooker along with the marinated chicken and rice.

8
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:26.400
Add some dry spices and chopped onions to enhance the flavor.

9
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.220
Stir everything together to get a good mix.

10
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.220
The aroma starts coming through as we sauté the onions.

11
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.220
Add tomatoes and cook until soft and blended.

12
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.220
Now add the ground masala paste and stir it into the mixture.

13
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.220
Let it cook well with the masala.

14
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.220
Continue stirring until oil separates from the masala.

15
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.220
Now add the marinated chicken into this mixture.

16
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.020
Along with that, add freshly ground garam masala and sauté everything together.

17
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.320
This is the biryani masala base.

18
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:30.300
Add chili powder and garam masala. Mix it all well.

19
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:50.400
Once the masala is cooked, you’ll notice the oil rising. That’s when you know it’s ready.

20
00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:20.400
You can see the color and texture change, indicating it’s cooked properly.

21
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:50.400
Add soaked rice and stir gently to combine it with the masala.

22
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.700
Now add 3 cups of water, adjust salt, and mix everything again.

23
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:27.700
Close the pressure cooker and cook for about 1 whistle on medium heat.

24
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:57.700
Once done, allow the pressure to release naturally before opening the lid.

25
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:27.700
Fluff the rice gently. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the biryani has a rich aroma and flavor.

26
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:54.970
Serve hot with raita or boiled eggs. Enjoy your delicious pressure cooker biryani!
