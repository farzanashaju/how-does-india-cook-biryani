Today, we will make biryani in a simple way. If you want a delicious biryani that can be made instantly, easily, and perfectly, just follow this recipe step by step.

2
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:40,835
To make this biryani, we will first cook the meat. Put the meat in a pressure cooker. I’ve taken one kilogram of meat. Add one tablespoon of ginger‑garlic paste and one teaspoon of salt.

3
00:00:40,835 --> 00:01:03,817
After one whistle, lower the flame and cook it on low heat so the meat becomes tender. Once the pressure releases by itself, we will open the cooker.

4
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:24,811
Now we’ll prepare the fragrant homemade biryani masala. Take 7–8 cloves, half teaspoon of fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 9–10 green cardamoms, 1 mace, half teaspoon black pepper, and 1 bay leaf.

5
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:50,713
This spice mix is perfect for a 1 kg biryani. You can dry-grind it or grind it with green chillies. I’ll blend them together, but you may do it separately if you prefer.

6
00:01:50,713 --> 00:02:05,715
If you wish, grind the spices and green chillies separately and then combine. I’m grinding them together with about one-third cup of water until smooth.

7
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:29,240
We’ll also use some powdered spices. Add 1 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder, 1 tsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin powder, and 1 tsp salt (keeping in mind salt was already added to the stock).

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:58,703
Let's start cooking the biryani. In a pan, I’ve added 1 cup (approx. 250 ml) of mustard oil. I prefer this oil these days as it's a bit healthier.

9
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:11,461
You can prep stock a day before—it shortens cooking time significantly. I hosted an Eid feast, so I made my stock in advance and finished cooking the next day.

10
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:30,935
I used the oil to fry three medium onions until golden brown. I’ll reserve one part aside for garnish and use two parts in the stock.

11
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:44,097
Now I’ve added two tablespoons of ginger‑garlic paste. One tablespoon was added earlier to the stock, totaling three tablespoons.

12
00:03:45,514 --> 00:04:13,087
Sauté this for 7–8 minutes on high flame to lose the raw aroma, then add one cup (250 g) of yogurt.

13
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:30,300
With the yogurt, the meat is partially cooked. Add the fried onions—two portions—keeping one aside for layering garnish.

14
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:46,771
The masala is partially cooked—don’t let it dry out. Maintain about ¼ cup of water in the gravy. Also remove about one-third of the oil.

15
00:04:46,771 --> 00:05:15,829
This helps keep rice fluffy. See, the gravy still has some moisture. Keep a little—don’t let it dry. The masala is now ready.

16
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:35,505
Give it a mix—this is our gravy ready for biryani assembly. Keep aside. Now let’s prepare the rice.

17
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:55,569
Boil about 3.5 liters of water. Add 1 tbsp oil (to keep rice grains separate), juice of half a lemon, and 3 tbsp salt.

18
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:18,689
While the water heats, note I soaked basmati golden sela rice 1.5–2 hours earlier. Always wash well before soaking.

19
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:48,810
Drain the soaked rice and add to boiling water. Cook on high flame for 5–6 minutes until the rice is about 80 % done.

20
00:06:48,810 --> 00:07:05,062
Now assemble the biryani. Grease the bottom of your assembly pan with some oil to prevent sticking. Add one-third of the rice (I divided mine into three).

21
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:29,918
Feel free to do a single layer if preferred. Add fried onions, coriander leaves, mint leaves, red‑orange food color, kewra water, and half the gravy. Reserve the other half for the second layer.

22
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:42,187
Now add the remaining gravy, then cover with the rest of the rice. I chose two gravy layers, but you can choose just one.

23
00:07:43,182 --> 00:08:02,334
Top again with coriander, mint, fried onions, and pour in the reserved oil. Also add the drained rice water—this aids steaming nicely.

24
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:19,817
Cover the pot and cook on high flame for 2 minutes so the vessel heats up. Then place it on a heavy tawa or pan and simmer on low flame.

25
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:40,961
[Repeated filler sounds—unintelligible—omitted for clarity.]

26
00:08:40,961 --> 00:09:09,261
At this point, gently mix the top and bottom rice layers so the masala distributes evenly. Cover and let rest for 10–15 minutes before serving.

27
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:32,481
The biryani turned out delicious. As you saw, it’s easy and quick to make. I hope you enjoy this simple yet tasty biryani recipe. Perfect for your Eid feasts!
