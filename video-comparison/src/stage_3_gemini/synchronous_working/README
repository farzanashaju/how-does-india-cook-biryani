Action Differencing with Gemini synchronously
======================================

Works similar to ../../stage_3, A bit faster unless you have a powerfull GPU.


- This was not used after a while, Has a few issues.

* Getting Gemini to use files from gcloud buckets was hard, there is apparently a workaround with vertex ai.
* Gemini's "file api" only allows you to upload 20 gb worth of data at once
	* If you lost track of all the uploaded files trying to rebuild the list of images uploaded is painfull, pagination is synchronous and takes a long time.
	* You can "preload" a list (or ~20 gb) worth of images for the next future x amount of comparisons but this is a hacky workaround.

- Good news you wont get ratelimited.
