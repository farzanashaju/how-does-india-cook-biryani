Action Differencing with Batch Mode Gemini 
======================================

Uses gemini's "Batch mode" which lets you upload a large amount of prompts and gcloud will atomaticaly run everything.

- This was not used, Has a few issues.
	* Batch mode on Gemini wont work unless you spend a certain amount of credits first? (had trouble getting it working)
	* Vertex Ai (also by google cloud) lets us use batch mode, but issues with uploading images. (gcloud buckets arent properly being accessed, region issue?)
		* This is something solveable and should be done.
	


Requirements
-----------
ijson
google-genai
asyncio (uploading to gcloud buckets was slow - Fix: use gcloud-cli instead of this script)
